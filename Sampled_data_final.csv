1,"The individual DVD holders in the box set came apart on first opening the package. The set of DVDs were in reverse order (the first episode DVD was last, the last was first). Two of the discs are unreadable by either my DVD player or my computer. The DVDs are seen as region-free by my computer software, which I find curious. Also, on disc 3, episode 5 is titled ""Flesh and Sone"" rather than the correct ""Flesh and Stone."" I put in an inquiry to the shipper (BBM) via Amazon's link and am awaiting a response."
1,"On average, there are 5 errors per chapter in this book. The examples given often use wrong units. The equations often mix current for voltage. This book has one use: it adheres to the common stereoype that electrical engineers can't write."
1,This company has a new revenue stream where they falsely accuse their customers of damaging their cars. They charge the deductable to the customers credit card and the reat to the customer's insurance. I would use another rental car company if I were you.
1,"Bought one of these a week ago at Meijer. Opened it tonight and read and followed all the instructions. It failed the very first self-test - the unit only displays ""Err"". (The instructions helpfully suggest that this means the ambient temperature is not between 60 and 98 degrees F - I'm pretty sure the temperature in my house is in that range, Mabis.) Tried replacing the battery - no better. The unit is just junk."
1,"I have a Wusthof Classic that's been sharpened so many times (a decade of daily use), it's come time to replace it. Saw this deal, saw the Classic line in the pictures and ordered.What was pictured is NOT what was received!Don't be fooled. This is not the Classic set, it's the cheap stamped out set, and because of it, this isn't a deal. A stamped knife is a stamped knife. It's cheap, light, can't hold an edge and while not really bad, is not something you want to use every day for years and years.It's a disgrace for Amazon to picture a different product in anothers product description, but it's my fault for trusting them with it and not simply reading reviews and making sure I'm getting what I think I'm getting."
1,"Thank goodness Judy Garland was not around to see this bomb. And that is exactly what it did at the box office for good reason. First and formost Ross is far too old to be playing Dorothy. An excellent cast is wasted except Michael Jackson, who somehow though this mess of a film, gives a good performance. After this turkey neither did Jackson or Ross starred in another theatre released film. The film is soooo bad that Berry Gordy forbid it to be mentioned on any of the Motown tribute shows."
1,I purchased this product to charge my iPod video on a recent flight. The adapter fit into the flight power but the iPod kept blinking that this product was inoperable with my iPod and to disconnect. What a waste. I loathe taking the chance of its not working on my next trip when I take my Powerbook along.
1,"Got almost to the end, realized it was a book a book about funds, almost through my kindle against the wall. Waste of time and money."
1,"I bought this thinking that you do not have to screw anything or stick anything onto your doors. I was wrong. Who wants to put screw holes into their doors? And, who would want to risk puting up adhesive and then tearing it off when you are finished with it? If you don't care about these things, then this is probably a great lock. But, I care about the appearance of my doors that will be seen long after I don't need these locks anymore! -My quest continues for a lever lock...!"
1,"This is possibly the worst group of songs from possibly the worst band ever created. I'd rather shove a pushpin into my cornea and pull by eyeballs out than listen to this so called rock music. If your going to listen to this music don't dare tell me that you like Zeppelin and AC/DC at the same time. There is no way in hell that you could possibly enjoy the two most polar opposites of the rock genre. This is like being friends with God, and Satin at the same time, NOT GONNA HAPPEN. My ears are bleeding as we speak for just listening to the first 7.89 seconds of the album. Take this review into advisement when your even thinking about buying material from this ""band.""REXER ROX MY SOX!!!"
1,"Cleaned lens filters for installation and found each had a hard grain of glass or sand or something embedded in the p,ane of the filter glass.... Hoya... What happened to quality checks After you moved to phillipines...."
1,"It's hard to imagine a worse portrayal of the Britt Reid/Green Hornet character than is portrayed in this film. Nobody expects realism in a Green Hornet film, but the portrayal of the great hero of the dark in this movie was so absurd that it wasn't even funny. Britt was a total waste with no redeeming qualities. The film didn't adequately explain why Kato would follow such a selfish clumsy bungling loser. The producers want us to accept that Kato, who could beat up 20 professional thugs with guns all in one fell swoop, couldn't beat Britt, who had never done any fighting. Somehow, miraculously, Britt became an expert martial arts expert at the very end of the film simply by thinking like Kato. As the film ended and credits came up, my wife said, ""You couldn't pay me to watch this film a second time."" It just goes to show that better filmic technology does not make up for a lousy script and and extremely poor character development. The TV series from decades ago was much better."
1,Anybody who is a DJ knows that Numark sucks. I hate this product so much every time i bought this and used it on my turntables it broke. Never buy this Needle is horrible.
1,"Hi: i ordered an idem for for 7.95 for a sweet dreams sleep mask and when i went to check out they charged me 54.00 what a rip off,look at your check out price they will charge you what they can"
1,I purchased two of these and neither one worked properly. It shows that an AC adapter will power the unit but this did not happen when I tried to do so. Avoid this product.
1,"I rented this movie for, I think, $3.00, and rarely have I ever felt as if I've wasted money so shamefully as I did with this movie. I should have just lit three singles on fire.This paranormal investigator movie was under-produced, overacted, shockingly underdeveloped and horribly written. The plot had potential until the actors opened their mouthes and the dialogue came out.There are some amazing movies on the paranormal. This is not one of them. The only scary thing about this whole mess is that someone produced it and Amazon agreed to put it onto their website for sale."
1,"Personally,I hated it. 30 pages left and there has been absolutly NO excitement! It might just be me but it seemed like one page they were talking about saving turtles and the next a dancing ivory monkey!!! If I havent yet made my point then you must not really be trying to read this! I read this for a class assignment and if I didnt have to read it I would have never heard of it! Honestly I think I'll try to stay away from books by E.L. Konigsburg because reading this book made me think that all her books would be unentertaining. If I could I would only give this book half a star so I advise you NOT to read it!"
1,"Based on the reviews I read, I had high expectations. But I was thoroughly disappointed by the quality of the kayak. 3 leaks in three outings!! All without any punctures from the outside. The quality of the inner tubes is very poor. All leaks were right at the seams, and very close together. I attributed the first one to overinflation. But that was definetely not the case for the next 2. And since they're all within a few inches of each other, I have to attribute the leaks to poor quality. The kayak is also not for people with average or above average size feet. They don't fit inside.This kayak is too unreliable to use outside of a swimming pool! Not even deserving the one star I had to give it.I also have an Advancedframe Kayak, which is wonderful, and absolutely trouble free. That I would give 5 stars!"
1,Are they serious? This was a ridiculous 'yoga' video. Who are these people? I am so tired of 'yoga teachers' (and I use that term loosely for these two) who have nothing creative to offer. This DVD was a waste of time and money. The movements were ridiculously simple and offered no real stretch or benefit to the body. Don't bother with it unless you want to waste your time and money too.
1,We are so dissapointed with this CD. It sounds a lot like the kids do when they are playing in the yard...loud and off key. What a bummer to have paid so much for it!
1,"The picture and description on Amazon.com wasn't anything like what I received. I was very disappointed, especially for the time I waited for it's arrival. I learned my lesson well, DON'T SHOP HERE AGAIN!"
1,"Short version: ReadThe Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artistsinstead. Even reading an internet chat room would be better than this drivel.This is not a book about 'how to' do anything. This is sophomoric stand-up comedy that fails to amuse, inform, or even seem to be attempting either. There is no useful advice in this book, but if you squint real hard, you can see the partially-remembered remains of recycled Andrew Dice Clay drivel mixed into the filler.This book, however, isn't even good enough to be offensive. A Maxim reader would be insulted by this book."
1,"It says ""Remastered."" It is not. These recordings are so bad they sound like old vinyl recordings after being playing a thousand times. By the time I got to ""Hold On,"" I almost couldn't make out what song it was. This is a great disappointment - and a major rip-off. Oh, and by the way, the carriage holding the CDs fell apart - now held together by rubberband."
1,"My son is 18 months old, and had the other FP Aquarium, the round one, he loved the music and the fish, and even played with it, so that we could get a little extra sleep! The music on this new one is terrible! It sounds like funeral music! The water feature is so loud, and isn't very soothing. He cries when he plays with it now, if he plays with it at all. Fisher-price should have never messed with the old version, I use to recommend it often. I won't be recommending this one!"
1,"This book is trite as all get-out, with a gaggle of silly women to-boot. How can the owner of a detective agency not realize he's been embezzled by one of his employees? I made it to page 30 or so, and that was a chore. Maybe I should have given it more of a chance, but there are so many smarter books out there, so why bother? Sorry if you are truly a Crusie fan. I can usually find something good to say about a book, but not this one."
1,"First, this is an opinion based upon personal experience with the Bid Buddy heater and should not reflect adversely upon any seller of the product. Received this heater as a Christmas gift. Out of the box, it did not fully function. The righ-side would not transfer propane to the burner--only the left-side worked. The switch for the fan was permanently ""on"". Did not matter if you switched it to the ""off"" position--the fan continued to operate. If they could not get a simple on/off switch correct, how do I trust the built-n safety switches for tip-over and carbon mono sensing While it appears to be well made, it is not. Again, tired of poor quality management vis-a-vis made in China products."
1,"This is the worst facial hair bleach cream out there. It burned my skin like crazy that I had to call the emergency and poison control center. The marks lasted well over several months. I reported the incident to Sally Hansen, but they never bothered to write back even though I provided all the lot and manufacturing info. DO NOT BUY SALLY HANSEN!"
1,"This is (contrary to popular opinion) a very interesting book about system development methodology -- well thought out and clear. However, the subject matter has almost nothing at all in common with the 70-100 exam. This book addresses high level methodology, but the exam covers lower level technologies such as data and process modeling, and ""extracting"" simple requirements from complex prose. The title of this book is exceedingly misleading. Buyer beware!"
1,My bad for not reading. I overlooked the remastered part. The sample of the song I wanted had no words in it. When I listened to it I thought I was going to fall asleep. My real disappointment was finding that the original is not available as an MP3.
1,"The one star is a boo-hiss for Baen books, which is re-releasing older books under new titles, apparently in an attempt to get customers to buy books they've bought before.This book is actually the books ""Born to Run"" and ""Chrome Circle,"" which are about a human protagonist, various supernatural creatures, and troubled teens. These books were originally part of the SERRAted Edge series of urban (modern) fantasy.The books are okay; not Lackey's best, but anything she writes is going to be worth reading. But not worth paying for *twice*! Shame on Baen books for trying to hoodwink their readers. There was no indication this was a re-issue when I pre-ordered; and even the book itself gave the older titles in small print."
1,"I was thinking of buying this book, but when I read that it is riddled with typos, I declined. Perhaps publishers will get the message that not doing proper editing results in lost sales."
1,I can't believe how tiny this thing is. It wont even allow you to make a blossom for a medium sized onion. It's useless to me. Only buy if you plan on using onions that are about the sizes of a head of garlic.
1,"Kitty Luv does not work for my higher-end system either (workstation class dual core 3GHz, 2GB RAM, NVidia Quadro FX1400 128MB video) even after installing the newest video driver and latest DirectX controls.The game crashes randomly. Patch v1.6 (actually installed as v1.8) takes away all functionality of the original. You can't even feed the cat! I quit before the cat died of starvation.Gamemill has released other unusable software in the past (Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing), it looks like they are doing it again.I just finished writing a letter to tech support to see what they can do."
1,I figured I'd save money and purchase this battery instead of one of Canon's for my S45 camera. My battery never charged. Just blinks red and green. Manufacturere wasn't any help when I finally reached them. Not worth it at all.
1,"The censoring of this movie is the real crime. There was no racism to speak of. The fact that it wasn't an all white cast at the time makes it better, but now it truly is an all white cast. I hate censors trying to tell us how to live. KEEP YOUR OPINIONS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE OPINIONS."
1,This movie is extremely slow and boring. The clip shown on the oscars is the best 1 minute of this movie. The rest of the movie is junk.
1,"The clock is exactly what I thought I was getting, in so far as material quality and appearance. However, the clock portion only worked for a very short time. The minute hand keeps getting hung up on the hour hand, so therefore, it really doesn't do what it's suppose to do. There is no way to take the face of the clock off to adjust the clock hands."
1,Twice I ordered this DVD and both times instead of season eight being in the case season ONE was in it -- Correct case - wrong DVD.... go figure!
1,this movie was awful. Please spare your friends and family. Only buy this for your enemies. GO find a better movie. You'll thank me.
1,"With this book, Montefiore proves he can navigate the Soviet archives. Unfortunately, he also proves that he can't connect two thoughts, write a coherent paragraph, or develop a theme. It seems that he has collected a mountain of quotations, which he can throw at any given historical event. The book reads as if it had been written by a rookie newspaper reporter. Montefiore can travel, in 1 sentence, through disparate unattributed quotes, through apparently irrelevant footnotes, and through myriad points in time. This is not history. It is not even journalism. Don't waste your time or your money on this hugely disappointing collection of words."
1,"I just received this cable in the mail yesterday. I tried to use it today. As soon as I insert the 6-pin side into the port, it is immediately ejected. There is nothing wrong with the port, as I checked it with a 6-pin to 6-pin cable. Both sides of that cable stay in the port just fine. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"I bought this item and it arrived incomplete! I had to use an old pieces of equipment (prior lighting fixture) to install the item. I tried to return but Amazon stated it could not be returned only exchanged. I also found I couldn't leave feed back for Amazon items, Very upset!"
1,"I read all the reviews before I bought this from Target and took them all into consideration hoping that I could prevent the problems listed. I cleaned weekly to prevent mold, I put a towel underneath to prevent water leakage, etc...It worked well for one month then I refilled it one morning and when I went to check it an hour later all the water was on the floor and it smelled strongly like something was burning. I cleaned it up and refilled it, then it was making a horribly loud noise. I emailed the company per it's instructions and after emailing them three times they have not replied.It's trash. Spend more money and get a quality humidifier. I recommend Air Swiss which is considerably more expensive but I have owned for over 7 years and still works great."
1,This thing leaks where the plug goes into the base. Overall the coffee maker is built well but I experienced the leak that some other people here have reported. I would not buy again...
1,"Someone else wrote a similar review, so I'm just affirming here: Lost in Translation is one of the best films of this year. It's beautiful, real and emotional and the acting is fantastic.The DVD however is junk. There's no chapter slip inside- just some advertisement for a beer company in Japan. You can't skip through the trailer after trailer at the beginning and the deleted scenes, while nice, are somewhat lacking. I expected a lot more.DO get this movie or at least watch it. But wait for a better DVD version to come out."
1,Do not bother with this purchase. It did not work right from the package.move on to something from your local big box store.
1,"I ordered this book because I have been very happy with DK's travel books. I guess I should have read more carefully: This is a children's book, not a book for travelers. Yes, I know the detailed description says so and I should have read it. But there are probably others who would buy this book based on DK's travel books and without looking at the details. Hence this comment!"
1,"Ordered September 30, 2009. Still not delivered on November 1, 2009. Requested an address change, which seller said was too late. Request posted September 30; book shipped October 2. 2009."
1,"The old saying is the harder something in the market is , the more likely it dont work.This is a lot of mombo jumbo.It may have had its time but the s&p moves more know in 5 min then it did all day back then."
1,"As an avid consumer of books about polymer clays, I was extremely disappointed in this one. It was basically a self- indulgent exploration of the writer's opinions. The artists discussed do NOT go in 5 directions at all. I have numerous books on the subject, every one of which is superior to this one. DON'T buy it!!!"
1,"why is this game so bad? because the graphics are not bad, but they are TOTALLY HERONDOUS!!!! its no wonder the whole team that worked on Final Fantasy VII was fired. Yep, thats right, and no one here will admit it. its a little known fact. So dont buy this game, play FF6 or FF8 instead, both of those are SUPERB FF titles."
1,"I played this game once and it stunk! The music was horrible and the graphics were bad as well. People, my advice is to rent the game first, then buy it. By the way, I beat this game in 3 days."
1,"If you are not already a Jordan fan, DO NOT become one. At least not until he finishes the bloody thing. If you have already been sucked in, do yourself a favor and buy it on sale, because you know you are going to buy it. I'm still not sure it was worth the $12 I paid for it. But then, books 7-10 havent been either. If you have read the short story as it was published in the Legends book, then you have already read this. Oh a little tidbit here and there, but nothing of use or substance. Its an ok book if you have a couple days to kill and nothing else to read. But if you read it and are disappointed, you have been forewarned. And if you read it and think its the greatest thing since sliced bread, well, I'm sure that its best I not say what I'm thinking. Until the next book...."
1,"I received this organizer two years ago for my baby shower and I love the convenience of having everything I need to care for my baby in one neat area at my fingertips as opposed to having to fish through baskets/drawers etc. So when we were expecting again and setting up another nursery, I purchased this product from Amazon. Little did I know that it would arrive broken and the return policy for this item expired 48 hours after it had arrived at my home. I didn't open the box right away as it contained holiday gifts as well- now I'm out the money and I went and purchased another one from a retail store."
1,The resons this moive stinks 1. Sean Connery is way to old.2.This is not like TunderBall shusss. So I gave This moive 1 star. BEWARE JAMES BOND FANS.
1,Bought two. Ran them all spring at opposite ends of the lawn. ABSOLUTELY no help. Not worth any money at all.
1,"I watched this movie recently and was looking around to see if there were any decent arguments about how this is in any way a movie worth watching. So far I have not found any. On positive reviews I see comments about how the movie is ""dark"". If you want to see a ""dark"" movie go see something else. About a third to halfway through the film this thing goes totally off the rails and becomes an incoherent mess. This movie is terribly written and the main character's actions are totally unconvincing. And to those that say he's mentally imbalanced that may be true but his behavior at the beginning and ending of the movie make no sense to his behavior through the rest of it because the script and the acting do not allow the audience to understand his motivations. Bottom line, this movie is totally absurd. It's not ""dark"", it's terrible."
1,I purchased 3 of these for work. They area a poorly re-engineered version of the Micronta I have. The fit and finish of the plastic is poor. The light bulbs shake and don't stay on. One didn't work at all. This is copying at its worst.
1,"I starting taking Leptopril about 3 weeks ago. I did not lose any weight and I felt very out of it the whole time. I had a constant headache and if I didn't eat every hour or so I got nauseous. I took them for so long hoping that my body would get used to the pills, but that never happened. Stay away from these pills!"
1,"read the other reviews. these bags used to work great, but in mid to late 2011 the manufacturer changed the size of the bags. they're now 2"" shorter and are not large enough for large deposits."
1,"I used this product over and over and it's not helping. Sure it takes away the itch, but there's NO WAY it removes the oil. I use it twice a day, I've had poison ivy for FOUR WEEKS now. I just keep getting it in other places. I'm going to go buy Zanfel."
1,"The handle will not stay up when I try to vacuum my carpet, making it a very painful process. The box was not in the best shape and this thing has not worked correctly since arrival.To get them to fix the problem with the broken item I bought they made me drive 30 minutes away to a 3rd party repair shop. This took about 10 days to ""fix"", I briefly tested it at the store and it seemed fine. As soon as I got home and used it for more than 2 minutes the problem returned and the handle would not stay up.I don't know what to do here besides cut my losses and buy another brand, terrible warranty and pitiful product."
1,"I bought this, thinking that with the upright design, I could use it one-handed (handy in the classroom). Not the case. I have to hold the shavings container with one hand and the pencil with the other. If I do not, the shavings container comes just slightly open and the sharpener stops working. In general, I love Panasonic sharpeners, but will go back to the front-loading variety."
1,"I purchase this instrument twice. The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned. The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all. I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense. This isn't a quality optical product."
1,"SYNAPSE - is a company that collects $40 each year to renew this subscription for Back Packer Magazine. There is no annual notification and since I was not the receiver of the magazine, I was unaware of it being continued, until I found the charge on my credit card statement."
1,didn't last even 30 days.. it just spreads the dirt it gathers... can't even pick up small hair type of stuff..
1,"Couldn't hold my interest. Too slow, boring. Pass it up - save your money for something you'll remember"
1,"I wouldn't recommend any of Oregon Scientific products. The Weather Station I bought had to be returned within a month because of multiple failures. The replacement lasted about six months.Oregon Scientific is noted for good looking products that have horrible quality control. Look elsewhere, I see some storm chaser teams rely on Davis Instruments equipment. I'm going to look into their products next."
1,"I saw this item and just had to have it! I run a daycare so it get a lot of use. There is one BIG PROBLEM...the tubes inside the sleeves never stay inside the attaching tube! I HATE having to fix it at least 2 or 3 times a week. I thought to return it, but it would have been more of a hassle to return it and the children I have in the daycare LOVE it. So I fix the darn thing! I wouldn't recommend getting this product unless you have time to fix it over and over again."
1,afeni once again continuwes to remix her son's classic songs by updating previous and unreleaesed material again I will not buy this crap I refuse to buy anything released by 2pac that was remixed and corrupted after his untimely demise quit whitewashing pac's music afeni.
1,"As with others who purchased this DVD set, it turned out to be exceedingly disappointing. Not only was the description completely misleading, several of the DVDs are unplayable.I will be requesting a refund. As an act of good faith, Amazon should pull this product (or describe it accurately) and allow other misled customers to return it for refund."
1,"I rarely buy a book without reading the reviews, and after having bought this one without doing so, will never make the same mistake again. What a load of unrealistic rubbish. Besides the weak storyline, the weak and unbelievable characters, the errors made by the author cannot be overlooked. Example: Beatrix was 10 years older than Raymond, yet met him while a debutante? Debutantes are usually around the age of 18 which would have made her somewhat of a cradle snatcher marrying an 8 year old. Even though I only paid $2.99 I feel ripped off. I will avoid this author at all costs in future."
1,"After a little over a year, my M100 died. The problem was diagnosed by an unofficial service center as a dead internal battery (it keeps the unit from losing data while the AAA batteries are being replaced. A call to Palm's 1-800 customer service yielded this solution: buy a new unit! I checked on the Web where I might buy the battery and found out that this is a lemon fault. Palm knows about this factory design defect, but they're not doing anything about it. I'll never buy a Palm again."
1,"The first week, the clipper is broken. 2 months later the plastic case is cracked for no reason. The case is probably made of recycled plastic so the quality is pretty bad. Do not wast your money!"
1,The very worst product I have ever owned from any company. The worst computer I have ever had experience with. There customer service is non existent. There quality control is awful. If you deal with this company you will be ripped off. I would give them a zero if that was an option.
1,"This product was ordered from Amazon.An empty envelope was received. To be fair, it did coontain a packing slip, but the merchandise was not there!Amazon has ignored inquiries.One Star means NO STARS!Caveat emptor!"
1,After washing I was unable to wear - had to throw away. So tight couldn't stand. Totally useless.
1,"The sizing is all lies!! I ordered a medium pair- supposedly able to fit women's size 6-10. I got the socks and it is wayyyyy too big! I'm a size 9, and this was colossal! The knit was also shockingly scratchy for having such a high synthetic fiber content- it has all the scratchiness and discomfort of poor-quality 100% wool! The seam at the bottom of the sock along the toe is poorly sewn up, overly long and bulky; it protrudes into your foot when wearing boots and creates a whole other layer of discomfort along the balls of your feet, since the seam wraps around almost the the underside of one's foot, and actually underneath your foot when the socks are sized for giants. So bummed to have spent so much money that, as a broke college student, I really did not have on such disappointing socks that I now am stuck trying to bum off on some unsuspecting victim."
1,"Bought the Honeywell HZ-910 (very similar model) in early October. Used average of 1-2 hrs / day in corner of garage. Heating element quit in late December, after less than 3 months of use. Don't waste your money."
1,"If you're diabetic you want to bring your cholesterol down so you don't want to have tons of meat and fat as this book suggests. Also, many of the recipes contain sugar or sugar substitute which are extremely bad for diabetics. I am shocked that this book was published by the American Diabetic Society. People need to eat well and healthily, exercise and bring the weight down. I would suggest if you're diabetic, you do some research on your own unless your doctor is pretty progressive. There's a lot of great books out there but this isn't one of them in my opinion."
1,"This book is much like a porn movie that has all sorts of sets and situations but each scene ends the same way. It turns out that every event in American history can be linked to the current Right Wing agenda and anybody who acts contrary to this agenda is berated in this book.If thats what ""patriot"" means I am not sure I want to aspire to be one."
1,"Evryones favorite man-child brings us his bizarre take on World War 2 and its not pretty. OK let me get this straight it was a WORLD war right. Apparently through my schooling i have been terribly lied to. I had no idea Americans single handidly won the war. And boy those Germans are some real cut ups. Mickey Mouse, Betty Grable what gams! Are you not listening to the campy B-movie dialogue in this god awful film? Speilberg needs to stop milking serious events for his own profit. Speilberg the savior of human kind. He's so caring. The Color Purple, Schindlers list, and now this. We must immediatly begin building of a spielberg temple, statues must be erected in his honor for all that he's done for us. He deserves a real pat on the back."
1,I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs tremendously and eagerly dove into Hannibal. I was very disappointed! I actually found the book offensive. Harris seemed determined to cram every variety of evil into this book. It felt as if the book was written to titillate a very perverse segment of the population. This seemed most evident in his depiction of the former child molestor turned child tormentor. I found this so distasteful that I refused to lend or donate the book and threw it away - a first for me! If you felt any connection or admiration for Starling you will be further insulted. I can not in any way recommend this book.
1,I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character. I wanted to take Frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.
1,"Not heavy duty at all. Not sure it will hold anything.I ordered two sets and am going to throw them away, not going to waste postage to return. I'm surprised Amazon would sell this junk,a mistake I will not repeat.GrillPro 60120 Replacement Rotisserie Meat Forks"
1,"After using it once and washing it, I saw the plastic cylindrical tube that holds the injection liquid was shattered/cracked. No longer safe to use with food. I tried calling the manufacturer to get a replacement, and they do not support this product. It is a piece of junk. Do not buy it."
1,"I bought it thinking it would be an improvement over my older George Foreman since it had removable griddles for easy clean-up. Turns out cleaning the griddles is easier BUT the splatter from anything other than thin, flat sandwiches is a 30-minute clean-up with 409 [countertops, counter backsplash, under-cabinet, unit's exterior especially knobs]. And I'm talking about cooking with the cover DOWN! I would never try cooking any meats or vegetables with the lid open. And I'm surprised they couldn't engineer it so that the griddles would fit either side."
1,"I loved the commercial - it made it look like a lot of fun but its not.My son received it as a gift at 6 months old and would sit in front of it but I had to do all the stacking, button pushing, etc... this is expected at that age. But now he's 14 months old and still has no interest in the toy. I kept pulling it out but other than clapping to the 1 and only song, it was not fun for him. My friends who have the same toy had the same reaction from their kids.I finally put it out on the street the other day - it wasn't worth the space it was taking up. There are MUCH better music and building toys out there - don't waste your money with this one."
1,*sigh*This is pretty disgusting stuff New Line is doing with this franchise. It says the Extended Edition is expected to release in 2011-2012... seriously? Very pathetic. Then to top it off they are re-releasing this. What a sad joke... >_>
1,"Choppy cinematography, poor characterization, and an incoherent plot. I'm not sure what the director was trying to accomplish, but the film as presented is practically incomprehensible. The fight choreography is nothing special, and the dialogue seems to lurch from one non sequitur to another. One gets the impression that better editing could have produced a very different (and possibly superior) film, but what is there just doesn't hold together."
1,The item arrived on time. The flavor might have been better if it was fresh. All I know is that the cake tasted stale. Very disappointed with my purchase. Not seeking a refund because this may be a subjective thing.
1,I wouldnt waste one penny on this and make these greedy parents even more rich. They dont deserve it and they need to get off the gravy train and BE with their kids and stop letting nannies and anyone else raise their kids. Its truly disgusting.
1,"Sir,The dvd purchased from you does not run regularly as the colour goes up and down in clarity. I dont know why it is like that. I have also played it on my PC and the result is the same.Please confirm whether you can help me in this amtter.Suresh."
1,"This audio card is good if you are only going to connect to two channels, and don't even expect actual 3D sound, no the left front and back will play the same thing also the right front and back. So if you are actually looking for a just stereo sound card this is what you are looking for. I almost forgot to tell you, it is a pain in the back to get the drivers, and when you get the drivers in startech.com you can install it but then wait until your screen turns blue... yes the blue screen we all fear... My advice is don't buy it! i will have to buy another one. i would give it -2 stars but that's not possible :("
1,"it irritated me how much everything about this CD was stina nordenstam-ish. the only semi-good song is 'stay tuned'. i ADORE good music and can normally find SOMETHING to appreciate in almost any cd, but this was not worth my coinage.:("
1,"I know beginners need a book wich talks about only a few topics, the most important. And it must be clear and not too deep way. But it doesn't mean you can take a time with each topic. This book passes over every chapter at the speed of light, leaving many issues unexplained.To all of this, it must be added the fact that the book costs as much as other really wonderfull and longer books.It's been frustrating that feeling I had while reading, as I have wasted my money and I'll have to buy another. Any search in google for oracle tutorials gives more information than that book."
1,"I bought one of these for a Halloween party. The lighting effect looks great, when the product is working. The gears inside would bind up in several spots. This caused the ball to constantly lock up. This is a big disappointment. We were all excited to have a mirror ball for the party. It is too late to get it replaced before the event... The locking ring for the light was also screwed on crooked from the factory. This bent the ring slightly. I was able to fix that, but its another indication that there is absolutely no concern about quality. Buy at your own risk."
1,"The book has some nice stories of how Dona B..got her life together through meeting Don Miguel..Other than that there is not much to the book.. It is nothing like the 4 agreements, except that she makes a few more which are basically spin offs of the Ruiz books..not actually any new information."
1,THIS IS NOT ELECTRO!!!! go listin to a little group called Jackal & Hyde and find out what electro music really is!!!!
1,"I cannot understand the good critics I have read about this book. I don't like to leave books unfinished, but when I had reached the second person that Eddie meets in heaven, I could not read one more word... I find this book terribly boring, easy and unrefined, bad literature, that doesn't know how to transmit feelings. Moreover it is supposed to be a lesson of morality, but it is such an empty morality. Does not inspire me at all. I definitely do not recommend this book to people who like real, good literature."
1,"While this is a pretty book with tempting pictures, the recipes are just not low carbohydrate. Just a short thumb through the recpies shows the following carb counts **per serving**: 66 grams: Winter Casserole Soup and Grilled Cinnamon Oranges, 47 grams: Cheese and Roasted Red-Pepper Stuffed Endive with Bran Cereal, and the list goes on. To be fair, there are some recipes with carb counts in the teens and twenties, but that is even too high for a person with high carbohydrate sensitivity. A second problem is that the recipes are way too fancy for every-day cooking. These are not staple-type recipes, but instead recipes for the gourmet cook wannabe. I'm sure there's a place for this cookbook, but I wish I hadn't purchased it myself, as FOR ME it was a waste of money."
1,"there is no resemblance to the band that put out two masterpieces in their debut and 'candy o'. 'shake it up' was the beginning of the end, but still had a few decent tracks on it. (cruiser, since you're gone). this is most certainly the end. if you like drum machines and synthesizers over good rock and roll, buy this one. if not, buy the first two.gets one star for drive, a cheesy song, but great vocals by benjamin orr. r.i.p."
1,"Product sent was not product that was pictured. Replacement continuously leaks and fails. Poor quality. Unfortunately, waited too long to ask for a refund. Kept thinking I could get it to work. Don't purchase."
1,"The DVD said it was ""like new"". However, it does have some places where it stops for a moment, then proceeds. I'm not a fan of the leaders first giving directions in Spanish, then in English. The music in the background has much less volume than the leaders. So in order to enjoy/hear the music so you can have fun dancing, you have to turn it up really loud, in turn the leaders are loud."
1,"After much research for an automatic pet feeder, I decided on this one because of the great reviews and the brand name I trust. I purchased the feeder for my 7 month old Beagle puppy in September to use throughout the day (for her snacks) while she's home alone. Within 2 hrs of testing it, she figured out how to get to the other 4 meals. Now, 4 months later, it takes her about 2 minutes to go through all 5 trays. I regret not sending the product back for a full refund. The feeder now just sits in the corner of the house...unused."
1,"Be aware that this edition is ""retold"" in order to make it ""easy"".The words are not the author's and this editiondoesn't have all the chapters that are on the original book.Unfortunately these facts are not part of the product description."
1,"This movie has bad acting, an awful plot, and it was just boring. The only redeeming value of this movie was the special effects of the nuclear explosion. The rest of it was a waste the time and money. Skip it!"
1,"I started reading this book thinking it would give a visual of the Bible brought to life through the eyes of women. However, I could not get into it as after several chapters I felt it was soft porn for women. This is the second time I attempted this book. I tried several years ago after it was recommended to me and put it down within a few chapters. I now remember why I did not finish the book.The author does a great job from what I read of giving the characters personality, so this is not an opinion on the authors skills, but I just personally did not enjoy the details of the sexual aspects and truly felt it could be rated as soft porn for women."
1,This battery is not working. I have ordered this battery for Sony Cybershot DSC-P100. I have received the battery on time and I charged it for hours but it doesn't seem to be working. The camera powers up and immediately switches off. I don't know may be I got the wrong one. It is real waste of time. I am going to return this and not going to recommend this to anyone based on my experience.
1,I have read many books on the Middle East. Some of which relate to this issue. This book is by far the worst I have ever read. It was long and boring. I had to skip many parts just to get through the book. This was such an important issue. She should have written it differently. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,"This movie is really really DUMB. 'I just signed up for the money dude.' 'I had no idea we were going on a 5+ year mission.' 'By the way, now that we are 2+ years into this gig, what kind of bene's do we get??' 'Hey, is that a cigarette holder inside your helmut?' 'Kwoool.' 'If your glasses fall off of your head inside that space helmut, it's okay, just take the dumb helmut off.' 'Hey, what do you think is in this cave?' 'Oh, no! It's a mean alien!' 'Listen, there's a weird sound at the door, let's open it.' 'Oh no, it's a mean alien!!' 'Why don't you like us? I have to know.' 'Wow Dad, you look like you are my great great great grandfather while I am still so young and pretty' .........at least the Alien series had Sigourney and a modicum of decent acting in it."
1,"The title promises ""the inside story,"" but most of this book appears to have been stitched together from newspaper reports. I kept looking for new material or fresh insights, but found very little. One of the themes is that the emergence of Internet-based investors' discussion groups has made the world a less safe place for ordinary shareholders. She doesn't present a convincing argument, however. After all, stock scams have always been with us."
1,"I would never purchase this rewinder again. It is very poorly designed and does not function well. There is only one button for both rewinding and fast forwarding. It is difficult to operate. And when it rewinds it does not stop well, and can tear the tape right off the reel."
1,"I think it is highly unfair that just because i dont live in America that i'm NOT ALOWWED to buy this game at the same time as other sims players, whats wrong Maxis - just because i'm English, is my money not as good as anyone elses. I find it insulting that i cant buy this game at the same time as other people. I have bought every sim game so far; if it weren't for people like me Maxis wouldn't be able to keep making games. After being treated like this i will not buy another."
1,"I got a different book than the one in the photo. The one in the photo is acutally very good. The one I got is about how to use canned soup to make meals. I never use canned soup. I really wanted the other book, in the ring-bound format I ordered."
1,The product did not work properly. When the faucet was installed the water gushed out all over the place. The product was returned for refund over two weeks ago. We still have not heard from anyone on the refund.
1,"I was worried about this memory as soon as I opened the package, for one of the two DIMMS was beat up like it had been used before. It also had an old paper price tag stuck to it reading ""$40"". The two DIMMS shared specs and were labeled as such, but were made in two different factories: one in Malaysia, one in Singapore. Despite being the right specification, as per both HP and Crucial, the pair of DIMMS I got didn't work in my computer. I returned them."
1,"Thank goodness a friend passed this book on to me, for I don't buy books written by anyone who has spent his/her life in the depths of Rev. Moon's psuedo-religious/political cult. But one has to wonder why it is that Gertz is acknowledged by numerous experts in the Intelligence Community to have inordinate access to inside sources. Could it be due to his Master's vast, unexplained wealth and the impact that such wealth has upon the Republican Party and religious conservatives?"
1,these dolls are very expensivethat is why most people can not buy itwe feel very sad that people can not afford itplease change it to eighteen dollars
1,"I'm not going to pretend to be an educated, experienced critic, but like 95% of you out there I enjoy a good book. Crying Wolf is not a good book. Abrahams stumbles through the story almost as though he has put the first draft out there! At times it is almost painful to battle through. He continues to ask me questions and then answers them for me in the next sentence or paragraph. Mr. Abrahams, please please, let me, the reader, ask my own questions! The characters, especially Freedy, are terribly inconsistent and poorly brought together. Like 95% of you out there I don't want to waste time and I'm sorry I did on this book. With hesitation and much less patience I will try some of Abrahams others, they can't be worse than Crying Wolf."
1,"Purchased a K2400HH unit from Costco for light use around the yard. The Honda engine works like a champ--but the pump is the pits. After only a year, the pump will not engage unless you hold the pressure handle wide open WHILE STARTING--i.e. if you let off the handle while washing and then open it up, the pump will not restart UNLESS you power off the engine. Karcher support was worthless. Local dealer said it would cost as much to repair the pump as buy a new one. I will shift brands on the next sprayer."
1,What a terribly written book.Must have been sleeping when he wrote it.A shame he let working people spend money on this.
1,"As they say, you get what you pay for. This fell apart a week after getting it. Had to throw it away."
1,"The feeling you get from reading this book is of a cop-out. Of an attempt to cash in on the stellar success of the 'Trainspotting' movie no doubt.'Ecstacy' consists merely of three lazy, half-arsed 'ideas' that would struggle to get into the far superior 'Acid House' collection of short stories. Irvine obviously didn't know how to tell his publisher to wait a few months until he could come up with a proper book. Fortunately the follow up to this ,'Filth', finds him back on form so perhaps this book should be seen as a 'mere blip in an otherwise upwards trajectory'. As Sick-boy almost once said."
1,"We returned this after one week. It doesn't even deserve one star. The VHS image is awful. The recordings were awful.It takes about a century to finalize a recorded DVD.The manual is hard to decipher.Sometimes it froze up for another century and responded to no commands, and gave no indication of why.For some reason it's being pushed like crazy in every electronics story and I'm sure most of them will be returned."
1,I loved this watch for a couple of days. Especially how the whole face displays the digital information. I could read it. The analog hands were also easy to see especially when you have the black digital display turned off so only the hands showed. The buttons were easy to press and in the same place and order as most Timex digitals. So easy to check the time in the dark.Timex has always been a reliable brand name. I could not believe it when the hands didn't keep good time. They lost a noticable amount of minutes in less than a day.I despair that even Timex has become a casualty of the global race to the bottom.
1,"All the comments here are spot on. I found a much better unit called the 'digisnap' (made by harbortronics) which works better, both as a remote release (longer cable, no filter) and a timelapse controller (much faster interval -- 5 sec vs. 2 min). Skip the Nikon unit."
1,"Oh my goodness...I can't believe this book exists :( Heartbreaking to think that there's kids out there suffering the 'techniques' the authors support to gain compliance above all else.Here's my FAVORITE review of this book, which includes MANY actual excerpts, and exactly why to NEVER considering using it's techniques on ANY child: http://www.quicksilverqueen.com/2011/to-train-up-a-child-chapter-1-part-2/"
1,I am a huge shoujo fan and this is deppressing. The art in this book doesn't even LOOK like manga. Even a begginer can figure that out. I mean I showed this book to my friend who doesn't even like manga and she could even figure out that Hart is terrible at manga. Beggieners or advance stay away! Instead of wasteing your money on this dinky little 60 paged book try the how to draw manga series. You might accually LEARN how to draw real manga!
1,"Many, many thanks to the French guy for posting the songs and original artists. I just finfished watching the movie and was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, being 33 years old! It made me want to find my old skates and lace 'em up and zoom around my block at 12:30am! ha ha... What a disappointment to look up the soundtrack and see how lame it is with all the remakes and so few of the great songs from the movie! I will be downloading the songs for sure."
1,"I purchased this title to have access to the audio portion. The price for the KJV is a great price given the fact it is both English and Spanish, however the main reason I made the purchase was for the audio part. The link to the free audio turned out to be computer read audio. If I had known this, I would not have bought the kindle book. If you want audio bibringeding by a person, don't spend your money on this one."
1,"I bought this blender because it was stylish, yet inexpensive. It worked very well the first time I used it. The next time, it wouldn't power up at all. I guess the motor just died. I was very disappointed."
1,To get this product to work you need to saturate each weed daily for a week or two. That is the only way I get it to work. The delivery system has extreme design flaws if you want to carry the gallon jug and spray and walk. The white connector pulls shut and stops the spray if you carry it and spray trying to use the length of tubing provided. The tubing hose is too short. This makes the product very frustrating to use. I also don't trust Scotts Corp at all with pet safety and their products after they fully acknowledged putting substances that killed birds in their birdseed. Beware.
1,"Although this book has wonderful pictures of Brazil, it also provides inaccurate information. Historical facts were completly twisted by the authors of this book who reveal extreme ignorance. I was surprised that they had in fact courage to publish a book like this...Don't spend your money here."
1,"This book of ""non-fiction"" makes almost as many fantastical leaps of logic with little or no evidentiary support as the fictional work that draws so heavily upon it, namely Dan Brown's ""The DaVinci Code"".There is a reason that this book fell into obscurity for nearly 20 years after its initial publication. The few sources of authority upon which the authors draw are themselves highly suspect. It would be similar to using medieval romances and nursery rhymes to support the existence of dragons, nymphs and trolls.Don't waste your time reading this book, let alone supporting the authors by purchasing it."
1,"Many Diana Ross fans didn't like her RCA years, but I'm one of the fans who thought she released some of her best work during her time there. HOWEVER, this album is the exception - Red Hot is so boring! It's starts off great with the sexy Dirty Looks, and then the equally sexy Stranger In Paradise, but after that it's just a mess. The rest of the songs are plain, boring, and dated.Since this was her last contractual album with RCA, maybe she just didn't care anymore at this point and didn't put in much effort since she knew she was leaving anyway, but still, when something's got your name on it, you need to make sure it will be something you'll be proud of later on. It's no wonder this album was her worst selling RCA album."
1,"A few pages into this book I stopped and thought ""what ...is this!?!""This book seems to be a collection of cardboard characters that have been combined with Mr. Carr's laundry list of complaints about current society and government. I've read Red Chinese propaganda from the Cultural Revolution that was subtler!Gee, so ya think the Internet leads to a dissemination of bad science and half truths? Why don&#65533;t you pound it in our heads over and over again throughout the book? No, 25 times isn&#65533;t enough! Please repeat it like a mantra!Yeesh.That and it also reads bad makeover of a Doc Savage novel with a dash of clumsy sexuality added.I really don't understand what happened after the two ""Alienist"" books but this was 99% worse than either of those.I so wanted to like this novel, but it took all my effort to finish it off.All I can say is ""WOW&#65533;... much as I would when seeing a car wreck.Mr Carr, better luck next time."
1,It takes too long to get to chapters and verses. Getting to books are ok but even that can be confusing. Should be user friendly . I tried to delete it unsuccessfully. I downloaded the Holy Bible ThoughtFul on to my iphone and it is the best. No problem getting to the old or new testament and the chapters and verses are easy to get to.
1,"Received the lock on time, but the clamp was on the opposited side of the u-bolt and doesn't allow the lock to be mounted correctly."
1,This band is nothing but a joke. I spent 2 hours of my life seeing them live play at Chuck E Cheezes and I want those 2 hours of my life back!!!!!!!!The people who are giving this CD 5 stars are actual band members. DO NOT BE FOOLED
1,"Do NOT buy this release! I repeat, do NOT buy it!!!! Now I do not actually own the set. I love Glee, I am someone who loves musical theatre and if you are a true thespian you will enjoy it greatly. However, if you are going to buy the show, WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER OR AT LEAST THE FALL. It's true that fox originally opted for thirteen episodes, but since the show's ratings went thru the roof, the decided to add nine more episodes to the mix. They also contradicted themselves by saying they'd release the full season on DVD. Therefore this release is a complete scam and ripoff, and not worth the effort to go out and buy. Do NOT give into Fox's scam, people. Just wait for the fall box set release."
1,"Well, my dishes are clean, but the stupid thing won't drain all the way. I've checked all the troubleshooting things, and none of them are the problem. I plan on calling customer service tomorrow, but from what I've read on here, maybe I shouldn't waste my time and should instead just enjoy my new 54 lb. paperweight. :("
1,This movie was very stupid and comic like. I cannot believe i wasted a couple of hours in my life on this movie.
1,"I ordered this product and when I receive it I noticed that my car seat model was not listed on the box, but it was listed on the website. After carefully looking at the box, I realized that they had sent me the European version which listed the European car seat models. I was very disappointed to have received the wrong product."
1,"Spend your money, and more importantly, time, elsewhere.I would imagine most folks interested in this text are preparing for the PE Exam. You should look elsewhere. Notably, the 6 Minutes Solutions book (Geotechnical) contains more breadth of problems, is nicely-divided into ""Breadth"" and ""Depth"" sections for study purposes, and *importantly* has minimal errors (the errors it does contain are corrected in an updated errata on the publisher's website).This text, conversely, is fraught with errors, includes simplistic problems that any PE candidate should already know, and is poorly-written and poorly-produced."
1,"Tried these for my 125 gallon Gold Fish tank. They ended up causing cloudiness in my tank. I was not overfeeding either, before somebody chimes in. I never had this problem before using them, and have never had it since I stopped."
1,I got this phone for my daughter's birthday as an upgrade from her previous phone. It worked great...for 3 weeks. Then it died and I've had a terrible time with customer service. I will have to find time in my overbooked schedule to drive 2 hours just to get my money back...and in the meanwhile my teenager is without a phone. I've used Virgin Mobile for 4 years and until now have been completely satisfied. Now I have to buy her another phone that she won't like as well...and hopefully the next phone I get WILL WORK longer than 3 WEEKS!
1,"I bought these candles because I thought they would look nice on my end table near the couch. At first, they did look nice. However, when I lit them they melted so much within the first half hour that the wax spilled all over the plate, off the edge of the table, and on to the floor. It took me an hour to get the wax out of the carpet!The plate and rocks were ruined too, covered in blobby candles and melted wax.My suggestion if you buy this set - DO NOT BURN THE CANDLES! Use it as a decoration only."
1,"This device is pure garbage if you use Windows 2000. Unstable, flaky, and unreliable... this is one of the worst devices I've ever bought. I even updated to the latest drivers, to no avail.The problems weren't limited to my machine, as my friend bought the same device and experienced the same problems.Please, do yourself a favor and avoid it."
1,"what a waste of my time!!! Horrible movie, actors should take acting classes, I don't know what Billy Zane was thinking when he was playing in this movie???ps. review with 5 stars?! Are you kidding me?! I think one of the actors left this review, lol"
1,"I bought this book because of the recommendation on the cover by Linda Howard. However, I'm glad I only paid half-price of this. Outside of the first chapter, the book is boring. ""Freddie"" barely stands up for herself. ""Bentley"" was by far the best character in the novel, but I had a hard time feeling sorry for him, even after the ""reveal.""I would recommend check this out from the library."
1,"I highly regret purchasing this book and plan to return it. If I had reviewed it in a store before making an online purchase, I definitely would never have made the purchase. Rather than being a ""Total Health Cookbook and Program"" it is simply a cookbook, a rather poor cookbook at that. This book only contains roughly 5% Dr. Mercola's health program. The actual health program is in his book ""The No-Grain Diet."" ""Dr. Mercola's Total Health Cookbook and Program"" appears to be motivated by a desire to build upon the success of his earlier book. A more accurate price for this book would have been $12.95."
1,"My husband and I are huge Simpsons fans. We eagerly awaited the DVD release of Season 11. What a disappointment! Each episode in this season is feeble in content and story line. The episodes fall extremely short of the usual ironic comedy, but true to life, situations that the Simpson family find themselves in. When Season 12 is released, we have decided to rent it, before buying, to assure ourselves that it is worth having in our Simpsons seasons line-up."
1,"The Zietgiest movies are more a cult recruiting tool than anything that ""we as a people must see"" These ""Films"" and I use that term Loosely are full of factual errors anybody with even minimal education can debunk. The Opinions offered give no real insight into society and rely mostly on fear mongering and Conspiracy theory. Anybody with half a brain should steer clear of this trash."
1,"I was not pleased with this selection at all. Of the five books I purchased through Amazon.com involving the single parent, this was the only one I could not force myself to read. Instead of giving you insight and advise on single parenting, the author used Bible verses that implied single parents were inferior to two parent families. Too much negativity for me!!!"
1,"This is a very lightweight, standard still camera tripod. The carrying case isn't big enough for much else then a still camera. Take it for a back up if someone gives it to you for free."
1,when received the refurbished IPOD the center wheel was loose and hard to manipulate. I am now unable to turn it off. Plan to request either a replacement or a refund.
1,"Another liberal movie with some weak intrigue to keep you dazed. I mean come on, your not even coming up with original stories to cover up your liberal agenda anymore! Demonizing the free market and glorifying Progressivism. Ya Ya capitalism is full of greed and has done nothing for the world, and progressivism has zero to do with usurping freedom, but only feeding the starving children. The Arabian Prince philanthropist who's only thought is ""of the children"" cracks me up! And of course his harem of concubines is for making more children and feeding them corn OF COURSE! WHY NOT. Lets just get as twisted as we can!This blatant hate of America in movies, is so beat. I could write this exact review for numerous new flicks. And I think I will. Wake up people!! Freedom is NOT the enemy. And if you think it is.... You will have the blood of Patriots and Tyrants on YOUR hands."
1,"Absolutely without a doubt the best thing about Teitler's `Taming and Training Cockatiels' is the wonderful color photographs, but aren't most color photographs of cockatiels charming? Decent photographs are insufficient criteria to distinguish a book on birds. The book is written in a boring style that reads like, `look, here are my pets, aren't they great?' The book lacks focus and unsuccessfully attempts to cover too much material. There are promising introductory sections intended for readers that have never owned a bird before where instructions on making `first contact' without terrorizing the cockatiel are given. However, just a few pages later there is a large section on breeding birds. Surely it's unwise for a novice who wants a tame, loveable pet bird to delve into breeding at the same time? If the author had focused on one area, such as a guidebook for the new bird owner while avoided irrelevant distractions, I might have been able to suggest this book."
1,i was so happy to receive my vac but one week later the charger stop working to charge it and now its i guess garbage. i need help and answers as to why the charger stop working because i only used it once. please tell me you stand behind your product and will replace the defective charger you sent me
1,"Product just arrived in a bunch of pieces. In red. They say it comes in two colors in the descrtiption, but there are no color options. You'd think grey would be default given the picture, but thats not the case either. It basically comes in red only.Not that any of that matters right now since It is basically made of chalk and will break before it even gets to your house.Im so pissed I paid money for this."
1,"Having read this nasty little book, I'm skeptical & suspicious about the comments from the reviewer who believes avid readers will love this book. For the avid readers out there: not only is this NOT a great book, the only way you could lose track of time while reading this book is if you drift off to sleep. And the only way the avid reader could possibly become ""totally absorbed and involved in the story"" would be while trying to figure out who was supposed to be doing what to whom when. Anyone who considers this book enthralling and a real high water mark in his/her reading simply must join the ""Cheesy Romance Novels"" Book of the Month Club. The author's ""unpolished writing style"" is not his only problem."
1,The style of these jeans definitely changed. I do not like the newer style. Not loose. Low hips. These are not the 569s of the past.
1,"I was disappointed with the music on this cd. The versions were not good, the music was not exactly as the one we're used to and some of the singers were not as good as those in the English songs. I wish I could return it."
1,"This is the last Cornwell book I will read. As a reader who devoured the earliest Scarpetta books, I've given the latest books every chance I could. No more. My thoughts on this one are: 1) She let her 12 year-old neice write it as a lark, 2) she remembered the night before the deadline that she had a book due or 3)she's bored to death with it all and trying to get out of her contract.... If it is #3, I wish her the best of luck."
1,"There is very little to be said for this book. Lousy dialogue, no suspense, and nothing that made me want to read on. We could also do without Pearl. Mr. Parker has reached a new low."
1,"I haven't slept for 10 days after finding out about the most recent changes to the original Star Trek Trilogy. In my marathon of sleeplessness I managed to eke out a modest haiku.I will not buy these.CGI is super lame.Lucas has no neck.It took 6 out of the last 10 days to write that, but I think it sums up the situation rather perfectly, wouldn't you say? The only other thing that I'm kind of mad about besides this whole Vader screams ""Noooo"" thing, is the fact that 3 out of the 4 local stores by my house won't sell me gold spray paint, Sudafed, or Crazy Glue anymore. Whatevs."
1,"The clips on this item are horrible. I ordered two because my hubby looses his, well they both broke within the three 1/2 months since ordered."
1,This is one of the worst products I have ever tried to use. Semi-transparent stain clogged the feed tube within 2 minutes of the first filling. And it leaks. Save yourself the aggrivation and just plan to use a brush.
1,"As an listing of available jobs this book is great. But for specific information, it really stinks. Basically this book is a listing of jobs and descriptions of those jobs. Each position is given a little under a page and gives a general description of the job only. This book does not go into specific strategies as how to get these jobs (other than know someone, stand out, have previous experience, etc.) You could literally go onto the web and search for these jobs and have more information. ...My recommendation is to go to your library or bookstore and flip through it rather than buy it."
1,"- I woke up one morning to find my two cordless units with message ""Searching for Base""- On the base unit, I hit the DEREGISTER ALL option- The display unit of the answering base shows the following message:E 2562M51 S51 FDXIMay 15, 200214:12:06All keys are totally dysfunctional. I tried plugging into a different location after 5 minute gaps and all other options.CUSTOMER SERVICE RESPONSE:They asked me to try plugging the answering machine base into other locations around the house after removing batteries from the cordless units.Unfortunately I barely ran out of warranty to take advantage of the warranty replacement process.Please advise if there is a fix for this.I obviously misspent $199 + $75 for the second cordless unit."
1,"the product was too bad, it's not the same description on the website,, it works with 120V AC which not clarified in the website,,, I'm really very angry with them...VBR.."
1,"I had a heavy solid rubber sanding block that I gave to my son. I ordered this one to replace it and was very disappointed. Cheap, flimsy light plastic and hollow shell. I can't imagine this lasting more than one good sanding session. Typical of things made these days, including most cars, appliances and tools. 3M used to be a quality-based company. Guess the good people in charge who cared about quality passed away. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a quality sanding block."
1,My husband loves these strings but I hate them. They don't sound any darker to me infact I feel like I am being whined at whenever I play and it drives me crazy. I play during my alone time for relaxation while my son is at preschool but since getting the new strings I find myself avoiding the violin. When I do play I don't feel like I have had any alone time at all because of the annoying sound it produces.
1,"This game worked fine for about a day, then it woudn't load for play.I was really disappointed.I haven't had a chance to return it, it's been awhile since purchasing it.I hope I can.I really wanted to play it."
1,"I went to Hasting's and found this magazine to see if they offered a better deal on a subscription. They do. The little cards inside the magazine offer a subscription for $19.97 for TWO years! So I'm sorry, but $15 for only one year seems like a ripoff. I Love Amazon and would much rather order through them, but this is one deal they couldn't beat!"
1,Do not buy this or any Cosmi or Starshine software. It installs Spyware on your computer and it will take an expert to get rid of it. Don't make the same mistake I did!
1,"Non-full disclosure. I was very disappointed when I opened this up and realized it was the Director's Cut, with score by Jerry Goldsmith. I was looking for the theatrical version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack. The story line is totally different between the two, and I already have the Director's cut, which I didn't want in the first place. I'm sending it back, and I would appreciate it if you could find me the theatrical version to replace it."
1,"I've installed the cd over and over and thought it was my computer that was the problem. However, I've tried it on 3 different computers at home and sometimes the computer and printer don't seem to recognize each other. It seldom works and when it does it takes up to 10 minutes to print out just one paper. Paper jams happen all too often and the scanner takes very long to run through and more often then not it doesn't work. I've owned this for nearly 3 years and it's only been fairly reliable as a copier. Shame on HP for on such a horrible product."
1,"I purchased this product and was then told of the reputation that EPSON products had, so I came here to read the reviews. At that time I thought that most of the postings on here were a vocal minority. However, to my utter dismay my printer simply stopped working after 11 months of use. I changed the black cartridge and shortly thereafter the print quality began to fail. Changing the three colour cartridges simply made the problem worse, and cleaning the print heads left the machine so hopelessly clogged up that it was rendered useless. Luckily the store I purchased it from gave me a complete refund for this hunk of junk. Shame on EPSON for making such poor quality machines - please stay away from any of their products until they learn to put products on the market that actually last longer than one ink cartridge."
1,"While the characters of Win Gerano, his Nana, D.A. Monique Lamont, and Detective Sykes are very well drawn and interesting, the plot/mystery of this book is not. Just when I thought we were getting to the end of the 'exposition' portion of the book, we were having the whodunit explained to us...as well as the political machinations behind it. Also of annoyance: the fact that almost every character has a nickname, and Win has two!I was just confused the whole time I was reading this book, and for the kind of book one reads for escape purposes, one doesn't want to have to think so hard. Not a fan, won't be obtaining more of this series."
1,The rotary wheel stops completely when I touch it to my skin. This product does not work and was a total waste of money. I am very disappointed.
1,"Bought this for my mom who didn't want to pay $30 for the charger at the ATT store. When she plugged in the AC charger the first time, it blew a fuse and powered down her computer. Due to this experience, she did not want to even plug in this car charger and risk a problem with her car. We learned the hard way that you get what you pay for. For this type of item, you're better off going to the Samsung website and using an online coupon from retailmenot or a similar site."
1,"Never having read any of his books, the synopsis sounded interesting. However, as a Christian, I found this one of the most disturbing books in print. More credible scholars than Dan Brown, even those in the 1st century, agree that the formation of the Bible was accurate. Jesus was not married and did not sire offspring. None of the 456 Old Testament prophecies about Jesus mention a spouse or offspring, but the ones predicted came true. DaVinci talented/genius? Yes. We humans do not want to read that something we are doing is against His will, so we make up stories to fit our lifesytle. The Word of God was given to 23 men to share in 66 books. Woman are vital to the church, but not as Dan Brown would have you believe. Read the Bible, know the truth!"
1,"I purchased this pre-amp for my phono. It works. For me who doesn't care too much to the quality, the sound quality is ok. However, the left channel stopped working in less than 3 months. Now I'm seriously consider a much better unit."
1,"Very cheaply made item. Not at all what I thought I was getting. I bought it to replace another one that broke after 4-5 years. In the item description, the first 2 pictures are what I had, the second 2 pictures are this and it is NOT THE SAME! I plan to send it back."
1,"One of my coworkers had one of these chairs and I really liked it so ordered one. When it came it had the small balance ball in the kit and not the medium ball which is required to properly fill out the base of the chair and give you proper height. The product picture shows the chair with the medium ball. The small ball they sent is pretty laughable. I called the customer service number I found online. I got someone in the Phillipines and we had difficulty communicating due to the accent. He told me he would send me out a new chair but when it came, it was exactly the same with a small balance ball which will not work in the chair. Now, I will have to call him back and get a return label to send the chair back. I have decided to keep the first chair since I have a medium balance ball that will work, but the price of the chair includes a ball. Very disappointed."
1,"This is one of the crudest cd's I've ever heard.There are other CD's on par with this, but if you don't care about content, you'll be just as happy with this.Definately not for kids (or prudes, like me)."
1,this software is awfulit moved drivers over to my new computer and effectively screwed up my computer with compatability errorsit made the cd rom drive disappear!!!!i had to undo everything and just use a flashdriveWASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Like many others here I noticed that this just isn't the right type of music for this movie. I came out of the movie wanting to get the soundtrack because of all the fast paced techno and rock that just makes you want to peel out doping 190 on the highway. If you like hip hop than go for it, but if you really wanted to hear the music from the movie, you won't find it here."
1,"This is the hardest eighty pages I've ever read in my life. It's practically written in it's own language. A good concept hides behind this book. Unfortunately, the plane blows up in the hanger before it even gets to the runway. Melville has a unique rating writing; he tells something very interesting into something not worth your time. Stay away!"
1,"I love the banana creme and strawberry muscle milk drinks, as well as the chocolate powder mix from muscle milk. However, the ""naturals"" drink just has a weird, unnatural taste. First time I thought the fruit I was putting in the drink had gone bad, but turns out thats just how the powder tastes. I think its the stevia, and its possible I just have defunct taste buds that dont like stevia, because I know several people that like the stuff. Either way, I would suggest you try something with stevia in it before buying this product. You may love it, and in that case, this is for you."
1,but i've been waiting for a whole box set since i do not want to buy each individual movie. but as i read all these reviews i can tell its not really worth it. which makes me sad. i guess i'll just have to wait. plus the price for this is ridiculous.
1,"Interesting to note that in the musical world of such a total left-winger like Tommy, all attractive women are addressed as ""mama."" Let's face it folks, this band (or more specifically, Scholz) has been on a linear line downward after, say ""Don't Look Back,"" and ""Korporate Amerika"" is not worth your hard-earned cash. Even a marginal effort like ""Walk On"" would have 2 or 3 tracks of interest. Not this one...time for Tom to hang it up..."
1,I am a HUGE fan of Phantom of the Opera but this story RUINS it. They should have left it alone. Not worth the $3.99 I paid to rent it.
1,"Instead of asking Ms. Smith, perhaps readers would be better suited to turn to the recommendations of the National Cancer Institute, National Cancer Society, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the World Health Organization, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, and countless university-based studies. A diet consisting only of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables is the best defense against diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer. The fiber in whole grain food escorts carcinogens and other toxins out of the body, while vitamins and minerals otherwise ensure proper functioning. In time, this latest version of the low-carbohydrate fad will look as ridiculous and baseless as every other fad diet. This book is just another example of commercial exploitation of people looking to be healthy without making any meaningful changes to their diets and lifestyles."
1,Got the Audiovox Xpress for my birthday in February. Unit died in July. Still in warranty but Audiovox refuses to repair it without proof of purchase unless I pay $90. Most manufacturers stand behind their products no matter what and those are the companies that deserve our consideration. I now have two Roady II's and have had no issues with them.
1,"Accutire MS-4652B Key Chain Digital Tire Gauge BlackTHIS SUCKS! IT IS A TOY! IT DOES NOT GIVE THE CORRECT PRESSURE!Looks Nice, but just extra weight to carry around.Thanks for the TOY!!!"
1,"In short, I have given two of these toys to my grandson and both quit working the SAME day. I traded out the batteries and the toy still didn't work. Perhaps there is a bulb inside that needs replacement but sure seems like a lot of trouble to have to fix the toy on the first day! My grandson is most disappointed as it, when it was working, was a cool toy for a little kid with a great light throughout the body and a vibration and little fan. Pretty expensive for a toy that only lasted hours though. After the first one, I gave the manufacturers the benefit of the doubt that I had gotten the one defective one but after giving the boy the second one and it doing the same thing (quitting completely!) I realize the toy is just junk. Darn it."
1,"I absolutely loved Europop, so I naturaly was excited to receive my copy of ""Contact"". However, just before I unwrapped it I noticed a note that said that it ""Can't be played on computers"". The only CD player I have is in my computer. Apparently this is some type of copywrite protection device. Brilliant marketing move, lock out half of all the potential play back devices. I believe in paying for my music, but now I've wasted time, money (return shipping fee) and still don't have the music."
1,"This is the first time I have wished that ""0"" Stars was an option.I am sorry I urged myself to read almost 300 pages of this just over 500 page shallow, vacious, piece of empty drivel. The characters are cliches and barely two-dimensional.The story line is inane, boring and pointless. Glad to see there are others who agree, but really can't understand those that think so highly of this book. I feel this was progbably the worst book I ever read, and I am an avid reader."
1,this is not what i wanted. the pot is not nonstick so my rice stuck to the pot and was hard to clean. the thermostat doesnt work well so the rice didnt cook well. it is absolutely not good.
1,The picture makes it look like its actually 9 bars but its only 3. This makes the product not even close to being competitively priced.
1,"Amelia Bedelia doesn't know the first thing about child care. In fact, she functions as a child herself! Naturally, the bumbling maid takes every written instruction literally and of course, you can count on her to bake something. When the child's parents return and see what a mess Amelia made of their place, naturally the wife goes ballistic. The husband shuts her up by shoving a wedge of strawberry tart down her throat. Once pacified with food, they relent and Amelia, drawn by a different artist and wearing a weird looking hat is back in their good books. Why? And did you ever notice that it is always the women who are silenced with food? You can be sure Amelia kept on baking as that was guaranteed to keep her employed."
1,"All the team members remind me of dry toast, boring with no personalities at all. They all seem to be going through the motions these days. I won't waste my money on any more of these sets."
1,This book SUCKED!!!!!!It's sooooooooo boring. It's so bad that I have already reviewed it but I feel the need to do it again. It's that bad!! Please believe me when I say DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!! I am the only sane one that has reviewed it so far as you can clearly observe above in fact I think that that was the author himself disguised as one of his readers just to scam people into buying his book. Take my advice...this book will make you want to hurl.
1,"This is a piece of GARBAGE! Poorly designed, flimsy plastic top that you have to hold down until the sealing begins....problem is the sealing NEVER begins. Run, don't walk, from this lemon. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling such trash."
1,"I have had many Norelcos in my life.So I can testify that when I say this shaver cuts the skin, it cuts the skin.Norelco designed the blades in a way that negates the need for the user to get in close around lips etc...I was bleeding in the first minute.It seems that overall quality seems to have droppedBlade life and battery life has descreased as wellMy 6885xl has broken parts and a bad batteryMaybe I can find an older model with the older blades somewhere"
1,"I just don't like it!!! I tried it on my neck and I just couldn't get it adjusted to feel good. Adjusting is not easy...you have to get up and figure out where the thingy is and it's frustrating. The massage heads are HARD and not cushioned well at all and after a while it's just irritating. The noise...oh yeah...that's very relaxing...GRRRRR GRRRRRR!!!!!I bought it for my husband (OK...it was a selfish gift), but he couldn't stand it and I swore I'd prove to him how great it was...well...I couldn't do it!So, there it sits and sits and sits...til the day I throw it in the give-away pile.Save your money!"
1,"Great when it works, which is about 6 weeks per unit. I was about to request my THIRD unit, when I decided I had had about enough of the Keurig brand name. The first one lasted about 6 weeks. The second replacement they sent last about the same. The unit will function if you unplug it from the wall after each cup. (If you need the exercise, this is the unit for you.)I like the K-cup idea and will look elsewhere for a unit that will last longer than a few weeks. Nothing with the name Keurig on it will ever find a place in my home again."
1,"If you buy this game, probably it won't work on your computer because of the several bugs it has and you will return it, after a bad waste of time. This game has lot of problems and the patch has fixed nearly half of them and probably no other patches will come, because the developers are not longer supporting this game. This lack of support is really bad and bad again...BR>If you guys are new at the myth series just buy myth2, it's much better and it still has an enjoyble community."
1,This is a disgrace to parents and children around the world. How could one possibly treat a child like this and feel good about themselves. It's pure abuse!
1,"The photos are nice, the quality is good.The only problem with this book is that the author included there a good deal of photos from a different country. I wish somebody told him Odessa is in Ukraine. As well as Crimea.He may check that on any map published after 1954.Maybe he did not notice the border because Americans are allowed to Ukraine without visas. Maybe Ukrainians should have changed that."
1,"I just tried this product and had a severe reaction. My face is bright red and has a burning sensation. The company does have a medical hot line which is a good idea. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with any product. My advice to you is not to use it and my advice to Biore is to pull it off the market, PLEASE!"
1,"I'm sorry but did anyone ever ask for the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition to be released without the bonus features? Second, the title is misleading because this really isn't a Limited Edition as the title so aptly states. Don't be duped into thinking this is the box set for the ORIGINAL EDITIONS of the Star Wars Trilogy.I find the method of releasing the Star Wars Trilogy editions to be quite strange. First there's a Star Wars Trilogy SE DVD set released with a bonus features DVD included. Then there's a Star Wars Trilogy SE DVD set released WITHOUT features. Then there's the new, limited Original Editions of the Star Wars Trilogy released on DVD but there isn't a bonus features DVD!Why can't there be a Star Wars Trilogy edition released with both the originals and the special editions AND the bonus features DVD? Wouldn't that save a lot of hastle?"
1,"My friend bought GHOSTS OF ANGELA WEBB for $5.00. That's about $5.00 too much. It is one of the worst ""movies"" we have ever seen. everything about it is poor: The script, the acting, the writing,the not so special ""special effects""...EVERYTHING.This is now the ""movie"" we base all other bad movies on!""I saw a really bad movie last night. It was GHOSTS OF ANGELA WEBB bad.""Beare: The guy who directed this has made OTHER poor quality movies (He made a vampire flick that was a little better than ANGELA WEBB...but not by much!)Any movie that you can tell in the first 15 minutes was made at home with a handheld camera should put up a red flag that the movie is going to be a dud.ALSO BEWARE the similar cheepie Horror movie box set VAMPS (another waste of $5.00!)"
1,"Why can't people be innovative? It is no coincidence that this album came out right after Portishead's ""Dummy"""
1,"I bought this camera as a Christmas gift. It was used 3 or 4 times and upon playback, the picture was unclear & showed ""pixels"". Sharpe said that the 90 day warranty on labor had expired but the warranty still covered parts. I shipped to the closest service location and the authorized service center fixed it. They shipped it back to me just in time for a summer vacation. It worked one day, and now it is doing the same thing again. I have shipped it back. Sharp says they use the industry standard warranty of 90 days on labor and they are sorry it isn't working. Amazon says that they are only the go between, so I have to deal with Sharp Company. I may have saved a few dollars buying through Amazon but I would gladly pay the extra cost to have a person I could speak to in person who wanted to keep my business."
1,I purchased one like this from WalMart. Apparently the one I got was defective because it overheated - didn't shut off when it reached temperature. It actually melted the end of a spatula! I took it back and I'm going to try a different brand - leery of getting another West Bend.
1,"Polder usually makes some decent products; this thermometer is not one of them! The only thing this thermometer does well, is flash a small LED once the temperature reaches a pre-determined setting. The unit takes up to 20 seconds or more to register the temperature of your food. In addition, the temperature it gives varies wildly depending the food. I ended up throwing mine away and going with a Taylor product. Much betterDon't waste your time with this thermometer."
1,"These earrings are very pretty, but the post is WAY TOO THICK. They killed my ears and I had to return them. I would guess the post is at least 2.5 times as thick as a normal post, and my ears did not like it!!!"
1,It wasn't what I thought! The trolls where different but the acting was really bad! If u like really chessey movies have at her!
1,"Please contact me if you'd like the REAL soundtrack, with the African songs, seeing as how the movie was set in Africa. I have the track listings with artists names. I think from there, a 'mix' cd can be made (iTunes), since there doesn't seem to already be one. It's been forever but I found it!"
1,"I purchased this and used it for two months. No positive results. I also used fertile cm, it worked for the first three days but no results since then. None of these products actually helped us. TTC over a year now."
1,"I use to be a huge Danielle Steel fan, adoring her books such as The Ring, Message from Nam, Wanderlust, etc. I stopped reading her books after reading The Ranch. The worst book I ever read. I thought I'd give her one more try by reading Leap of Faith. She's clearly only in it for the money now - cranking out garbage. Leap of Faith was too predictable with shallow, uninteresting characters. I won't be wasting my time on her books again."
1,A friend recommended that I should get their CD because they rock! So I did. Boy were they wrong!!! These guys suck big time. Just another cookie cutter pop/rock (boring) band of today. I will never buy a CD of these guys ever again and I will never listen to my ex-friend!!
1,Irresponsible. Promoting surviving anything in a few paragraphs of information is a set up for leaving the gene pool at an accelerated rate. Common sense and real life emergency scenarios have proven this for decades. Fun for the coffee table and wannabe only.
1,"I would strongly recommend no one buy this product...as many other reviewers said it smells nothing, absolutely nothing like a vanilla birthday cake, or any cake for that matter. I am very likely not to try any more of their products. There is only 1 3-1 that I would recommend, the Double Dutch Chocolate (I think that's the name, it is sold here at the Amazon site. I even wrote to complain and was told that they only return ""gently used"" products, what a rip-off (I want to use a more eloquent term, but rip-off is what it is). If I could rate this at less than one star I would."
1,"I don't have really high standards for the anime I watch, but this show crosses all the boundaries. I was expecting a lively, smart romantic comedy, but this show feels more like the dramatization of some thirteen year old kid's diary. It's about one third boring everyday stuff, one third whiny, sniveling inner monologues, and one third recap stuff, which is mostly just a transparent excuse for more inner monologues. Since the recaps are usually cumulative for the whole show, they just get longer and longer. Also, as the relationship progresses, the main characters get more and more obnoxious and arrogant, especially the girl. Why is everyone so amazed by this show? People should take some more time to think this over, rather than just jumping on the bandwagon and proclaiming the greatness of what is, at it's heart, a mediocre, half-hearted series."
1,"my husband had not one, but two of these phones in less than a year and they were both lemons! The first one he had, the person on the other end could not hear you talking at all - it was like no one was there! The phone was brand new! He had it replaced with the same phone and this one you could not hear anything on it! He finally sent it back and just got a totally different brand of phone entirely. I don't know if we just got two bad phones or if this phone is just not a good phone. Either way, we'll never have another one!!!"
1,I just recieved a second set of the dvds and this set does not play either. I have tried to play the set on two different dvd players and a laptop and it still wont play. Since its the second set of the dvds ive recieved and still have the same issue its obviously a product defect. Does anyone know how to get the disc to play? i dont think its a region issue because i bought the set from amazon and im in the US.
1,"I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED! I COMPLETELY THREW MY MONEY AWAY ON THIS ONE. IT ONLY HAS A FEW PAGES, AND DOES NOT TALK ABOUT JUSTIN OR BULL RIDING. IT MADE NO SENSE TO HUSBAND AT ALL. I AGREE WITH HIM. PLEASE, DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THIS ONE!!"
1,"All young writers should have good editors. The book is, like most first novels, fresh and interesting, but ultimately self-indulgent; replete with author intrusion, self-congratulatory cleverness, and a whole lotta time wasting. Character development is virtually nonexistent and the plot doesn't so much advance as trail off into some unexplored corner of the house of title fame.People posting reviews who compare this book to Nabokov or Borges really should go back and re-read some actual Nabokov or Borges, either of whom can say more in a page than this writer can say in a hundred.It's a nice try. It has some decent ideas. Postmodernists will probably like it, 'cause it's all so avant garde doncha know. But it really isn't a novel so much as somebody's writing journal accepted for publication. Read _Pale Fire_ or one of JL's parables, and save yourself a week."
1,"As fairly avid gamers, I have to point out that this is only the second game we've refused to finish due to a rapidly-escalating frustration level. I enjoyed the original TR, skipped the middle two, and hoped to recapture the fun with TR4, but no luck. Play Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine instead -- a MUCH better game."
1,"I am a big Nora Roberts fan, and although I usually read her books in between heavier reads, I always enjoy them. This book was a really big disappointment. As a previous reviewer stated, most of the dialougue was nothing more than arguments between the very boring characters. Nothing in this book was believable or intriguing. I've read all of her books, and this was the first one I almost didn't finish. This read like one of those cheap, romance novels. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
1,"The fact that her husband tells her he is leaving her the day after the birth of their daughter is the only original thing I could found in the book. For the rest... a shallow, selfish and immature woman's ego trip. And the end! Her husband cheats on her because he loves her too much? Oh, boy! And predictably, she has fallen in love with someone else... in a month!"
1,This man cannot sing! He sounds like a freight truck going across a bumpy road! I recommend Kindred-family soul or Javier-. These 2 discs will blow you away. Great quality music! I wil be selling this cd!
1,"IMO this is not a good book to read. The author bounces around on too many subjects. He starts off talking about what is going on aboard the Prinsendam, but doesn't stay there very long. He soon veers off telling the history of:the coast guardthe rescue basketthe hoist systemcoast guard boatsthe coast guard crewhistory of past ship disasters......it just gets so boring that I find myself skipping full pages, hoping to find my way back to what is going on aboard the ship again. The author finally gets back to the Prinsendam, then a couple of pages later, he is back to the history of......something that happened in 1745. Uhhhh!!!If I wanted to read history, I would open a history book."
1,"Th actual DVD is good and I use it often.With that being said, sadly, I can't support the sales of Rodney Yee. He was kicked out of the Yoga Alliance for dating his students. He left his wife and 3 children to marry a model / fellow guru. I don't trust his motives. Google search him. There are a lot of articles about his unscrupulous transactions. You decide."
1,We got this on 12/25/11 and by 12/31/11 the hinge had broken. We used it each morning for waffles during those days but 6 days and it's completely broken is totally unacceptable. I expected more from Black & Decker. We've returned it and will be purchasing a different brand.
1,I have purchased 5 of these items and they break after 5-6 months of street riding. I'm glad I had the fore thought of using the GPS strap to secure the unit to my handlebar or the GPS would have bounced on the concrete street. I really enjoy the GPS unit and the handlebar mount is a great idea --- I only wish it would not break for no reason!
1,"I bought this cam because it was cheap. You have to have bright lighting to see much of anything on the screen. It took several tries to connect, and my XP tried to reject it during installation once. It also does to stay turned all the time when you turn the top on the base."
1,Although I bought this heating pad in March 2011 we had seldomly used it. It does not work at all now--not even a year old! I have tried different temperature/time settings thinking that it might work at some setting(4 settings). Out of luck--no heating at all!Total waste of money. I should have bought a less expensive plain heating pad from a drug store rather than spending a lot more money on this fancy stuff made in Taiwan. I had bought an inexpensive electrical heating pad five years ago--it is still working.
1,"This ruined sonic completely the storyline is whack the 2player mode sucks and kinda hard the way the you run and there's a space or a part you get stuck in, the old sonic games were more better with better storyline and design this game was a little off balance, so this game was'nt good at all."
1,"I know it's been said, but I feel the need to repeat it in this case: George Lucas at this point is just sticking it to the fans. I don't WANT the 2004 versions, I bought that box set when it came out on DVD. I don't want the comic books, either. I just wanted a box set of the original movies. And this time I'm not biting. I don't care that much about the tweaks he made, I'll stick with watching the 2004 releases that I already own and do NOT need another set of. I'm a fan, not a junkie, and definitely not rich enough to keep giving Mr. Lucas money for stuff I already paid him for."
1,"If the process industry really is consulted by stuff like this, then it is a wonder that process automation serves to enhance productivity. This confusing conglomerate of disparate accounts is likely to be understood only by the authors themselves."
1,"This product had a very rancid smell and a sticky texture. I think the shea butter may have been mixed with something, but definitely was not pure. More greasy than moisturizing. Very disappointed that I spent money on this when I've gotten better shea butter for way cheaper."
1,"More like animation from 20 years ago, and they hadn't even made animation yet, to me this is not expectable for publishing, SHOULD BE RATED CRAP standing for CRAP"
1,"I love the adventure travel genre, but this one doesn't make the grade. The book is the day-by-day diary of a round-the-world cyclist. Adventure? Excitement? Not!A typical day's entry reads something like: ""Left at 9:30 and rode xx Kms. to 'name of town'. Horrendous headwinds all day. Checked into a hotel -- can you believe they only have 2 satellite channels on the TV? No McDonald's in town so I went to the hotel restaurant and had a steak."" No kidding.After a bout of food-poisoning he takes a month off in Perth, Australia. This time period includes September 11, 2001. His jornal entry? ""Did nothing"".If you want adventure bike travels read something by Anne Mustoe instead."
1,"EVERY SO OFTEN A TALENTED MUSICIAN OFFERS UP A CREATION THAT MAKES THE LISTENER THINK ""WHY""???? WELL THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS REVIEWER THOUGHT AND IN MY OPINION THIS IS MY BIGGEST DISAPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR FOR RELEASES.LINSEY'S VOCALS ARE MUFFLED WITH AN ANNOYING ECHO EFFECT AND IF THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO CREATE SOME SORT OF AMBIENCE,FORGET IT.THE SONGS,WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A REMAKE OF THE STONES ""I AM WAITING"",ARE VERY MEDIOCRE AND BELOW THE STANDARD TO WHICH LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM CAN PRODUCE.I UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THE MATERIAL WAS RECORDED IN HOTEL ROOMS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT!!! PASS ON THIS RELEASE,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,"I'll be honest - I only bought this because my favorite perfume doesn't have a conventional cap and could not use it with my Travalo. I thought this would be a good alternative because I could spray it directly into the glass bottle and take it with me. The first day I got this I loved it. It was so easy to use and it seemed to be secure. However, after a couple of days it started to leak in my purse. At first I wasn't sure if it was because I hadn't screwed it on tight enough, but when I went to unscrew it I noticed it was definitely tightened as much as it could go. I have no idea how this leaked, since it seemed to be secure, but it did and I wasn't happy to see that my expensive perfume was totally wasted. At least two good things came out of this: (1) Luckily I didn't fill it up completely in the first place specifically for the purpose of having leaky atomizers in the past (lesson learned) and (2) at least my handbag smells good! :/"
1,"Bjork, having achieved momentary diva pop stardom, is doing everything in her power to erode her fan base. This self-indulgent waste of time will be available soon for $1.35 as merchants attempt to recover their investment. A classic example of the ""Emporer's New Clothes"" story in real life. As the kid finally blurted as the naked Emporer strode through town, ""HE HAS NO CLOTHES ON!!""... Bjork has released an album where ""THERE'S NO MUSIC!!"" Sure, the intelligentsia may gush... but don't be fooled.There is nothing but empty vocals. And I mean nothing. It sounds like she's recording ad lib moments. THAT'S IT. Song after song. It makes you long for the days when she used more conventional instrumentation, like the xylophone made from car exhaust pipes or the Innuit Choir and music box...A collosal waste of time, money, and talent.Re-unite with the Sugarcubes already and forget this lame solo career."
1,"I recently ordered an ASUS Eee Top touch screen PC, and Amazon recommend to buy 2GB Memory for upgrade purpose. I did bought the memory, but when I received the PC, there is no instruction how to open the back cover. I called ASUS to get instruction to open the back cover. They told me the cover can not be opened and asked me to call Amazon get instruction to upgrade memory card. ASUS never suggested customer to do so."
1,They sent me the wrong product and did not rectifythe problemlast time I buy from this place
1,Just like the title says...thinly veiled soft porn under a very weak layer of fantasy. She should write for the skin magazines and not even be considered an author in the SF&F genre.
1,"Time for Mr. Allen to move aside, I'm afraid. This film is an embarrassment for all but his most dedicated fans. Deconstructing Harry was brilliant. He should have quit when he was ahead."
1,"I read this book I don't remember how many years back. I think about 15 years ago. And just remembering makes me nauseous, for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point. I was younger, naiver and I got engaged, I confess that. Clever Author no doubt, to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead. Just wandering around and playing with analogies. I had the time back then, I guess. Today I only have the time to write a review stating how surprised I am today I could finish this kind of book. I can't speak for anyone else, suffice to say I was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands."
1,"Junk!!! It is huge and rubbs the other fingers next to any finger I put it on. It looks hideous, and I could tell no benefit from it."
1,"Please. I have read most of Clancy's books and enjoyed them. This one, however, was worse than any biological assault an evil nation could think of. I really wanted to give it no stars, but alas I can not. Clancy's political views and somewhat poor understanding of public administration aside, the plot was absurd, dull, and predictable. And the shallow, trite dialog leaves me at a loss for words!"
1,This fan is labeled as a silent fan. It is very loud on its lowest setting and the fact that it is advertised as silent is false. The entire fan is plastic so it looks extremely cheap.
1,"I saw this movie for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was so bad I don't really remember much more than checking my watch every couple of minutes wondering how much more time I had to spend on this awful movie.I don't recommend this movie unless you have a real jones for Antonio Banderas, and even then, rent Spy Kids, at least the movie has a little bit of a plot."
1,"I watched this movie years ago, and throughout watching it I realized it was absolutely god-awful. I wanted to just stop the tape many times throughout watching it, and return it to the rental store. It was not worth the 2 hours of my life to watch the BB return to the big screen. The kid is annoying as hell, John Goodman could never fill the big shoes that John Belushi left. The police car crash scene is too long to be belieavable and it ends up not being funny. Don't bother paying to buy this piece of garbage!"
1,"I bought this item 11 months ago & I've only used it ~10 times. I tried to use the toaster this morning, & it is DEAD. Be warned - this is a poor quality product."
1,"I was totally disappointed with this movie. It's not even in the same class with ""Saving Private Ryan."" It's boring, historically inaccurate, and drags on way too long. Don't expect to learn anything about the real battle of Guadalcanal from this trash. The battle scenes are very routine and nothing special. From what I recall, historically, the Americans were on the defensive. However, in this movie they are attacking. This movie was soo boring that I couldn't even finish watching it. Don't waste your time with this movie unless you have insomnia."
1,"little fun, cheesy graphics. The beginning gets you excited, the music is nice, ok, but it seems repetitive, the orc monsters unimaginative, and you just walk quickly down roads in the snow hoping to find an apple before you starve, which happens all-to-soon. Boring. Most of the time you just try to figure out what to do, what you can do, which is not much, or you wish you would be told what you should do. Save your cash. I put mine in the trash.Apparently, at the beginning, you have to pay the ferryman when given a choice. I figured out that much. Very disapponting."
1,"I ordered this costume for my 2yr old, but when it arrived, the costume in the bag did not even resemble the picture. For starters, the 2-3 size toddler was so small, you would be lucky to get it on a 1 yr old. The ""so-called red thick sash"" turned out to be a very small piece of black string. And they do not take returns, so it just will end up in the garbage. What a waste...I will never order fromt this seller again!!!"
1,"La calidad es pésima, no corresponde a lo que en algun año ya bastante pasado fué Angelica Hartman.Es una barbaridad, pero en fin, no es lo mismo Los tres mosqueteros que Veinte años después."
1,I loved Le Carre's early works and the he went down hill and this one hit bottom. I finished this book looking for at least ten more pages. I thought the printer left them out.
1,"This book has no table of contents, no annotations and no index. The painting on the cover is not identified. Since these sonnets are available in many places, free of charge, and there are several other inexpensive editions with a table of contents, index and other information, it is difficult to understand why anyone would buy this particular book. If you look carefully you can find a date on the bottom of the last page. The date is 11 January 2012. I received my copy 13 January 2012. One of the other reviews is dated 2004 and some of them refer to it as a Folger's library edition. This is not a Folger's library edition as some of the other reviewers have indicated. There certainly seems to be a mismatch between the reviews on Amazon and the book I received. I returned it to Amazon the same day it arrived."
1,"I have not read this book, but I could probably tell you just about everything it says. Research two things regarding this. ""The Myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy"" and the writings and actions of Jefferson Davis and General Jubal Early in the years following the Civil War. You will find an organized, systematic propaganda campaign that covered reasons for the war and justifications for succession and for the barbaric para-military campaigns carried out by Nathan Bedford Forest and others under the banner of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan against Afirican-Americans. When you make a statement regarding slavery that lessens the fact that it was a dehuminizing, cruel, barbaric, unethical, and unChristian institution, then you are making a dehumanizing statment too."
1,"There is a thin line between paying homage to an era, and completely ripping off one song after the other. This entire album is an exercise in song recycling and bad production. The album tries to come across as laid back and fun, but instead seems forced and desperate. Jessica has never really made any real waves with her music, and this album cetainly won't be changing that.With opening sales close to those of Paris Hilton's debut, this could very well be the last album we here from jessica."
1,"This book was absolutlely horrible. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers quote ""In case of fire, throw in"". Charcters were all one dimensional, writing was on a grade school level and the book only seamed to criticize men. After reading Middlesex, Virgin Suicides and one of my new all time favorite books Life of Pi, this book was terrible.The book is about a girl named Lily who lives in a fantasy world where everything falls into place like in a Utopia or Eden like world. She escapes her monster like Father to live another life with three other woman after escaping her and her live in maid out of jail to another part of North Carolina. From there, it becomes the silliest garbage you have ever read. MEN, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!! I will never read Sue Monk Kidds books again. Thank God I am done with this book!!!! Good Morning America rated this book as a must read. I rate is as a must not read. If I could have rated it a zero, I would have."
1,"IS THERE A SONG THAT SHE HASN'T REMIXED?!! SHE'S WORSER THAN BAD BOY, PUFF PUFF'S LABEL. Speaking of puff, thats probably where she gets it from"
1,"This book was just so bad I couldn't finish it.I own over 1000 books ranging from the classics (including P&P;) to downright fluff and chick lit. This book is at the absolute bottom of my list. I've only written one review before, it was for an apallingly poorly written book. This book is even worse."
1,Dropped Kindle (in a protective case) from 12 inches and screen broke. Way too delicate for a portable device. Amazon charges two hundred dollars for a screen repair to ship you a refurbished kindle (which is pathetic considering they just dropped prices of brand new devices). The poor durability and outlandish repair cost drop this to a 1 star.
1,"I was really disappointed with this product. I see now that I should have read the description more carefully, but this is NOT the same filter that my Honeywell Hepa filter came with. Pretty unhappy."
1,"Basically a pathetic rip-off of Resident Evil with a model that looks nothing like Bruce Campbell. It's just no-good. Got it cause Evil Dead movies rule, but this game just sucks, no two ways about it."
1,"I was disappointed by this CD. The quality of the recording is poor, and the music itself isn't anything to write home about."
1,"I've been a fan of LOVE since introduced to Forever Changes back in 1969. That remains my favorite LOVE album, so I was excited when the news that Bryan Maclean had put out an album began to circulate. After seeking it out in record stores for several years, I finally found it here. My disappointment is profound. Instead of new material, all I found was a weak collection of musical doodlings which would have been better off consigned to the trash bin. There is almost nothing even tolerably listenable on this album. Like Simon and Garfunkel, the team of Lee and MacLean was a much stronger unit together than apart."
1,"I tried to watch this movie. I really did. But I lost interest about ten minutes into it, and ended up zoning it out unwillingly all three times I've sat down in front of it. What plot there may be is boring, copied stuff, and it's not very well-written. I did not like any of the characters, and the action scenes were average for the genre. It was a total waste of time for me to attempt to watch this movie--I wish I could get those hours back. Pass on this one; there are hundreds of better movies out there."
1,"This was by far and away one of the most moronic pieces of sophmoric trash of the Nineties. Pitiful screenplay, terrible acting, and amateur direction all painfully plague this horrendous flick. Everyone who enjoys this idiotic waste of film must have an iq of less than 2."
1,"I am usually a very positive person, and I love Adam Sandler, so I was excited to see ""Punch Drunk Love"". The best part of the movie was the credits because I was finally able to tell myself that the pain and torture I had endured for the last 90 min was finally over. Everything about this movie [was bad], and there were at least 20 or 30 events in the movie that had absolutely nothing to do with the film. This is a perfect example of why we need to get the drugs out of hollywood because anybody who approved the script was obviously high on something more then life. By all means rent this movie, or buy it of you would like to take a nice nap, but I would much rather see a KPBS special where the cast of the Power Rangers, Barney, and telletubbies get together to talk about crossing the street. I only gave this movie 1 star because there was no lower rating. had I been able to take away stars that other people gave, I would have done so."
1,"Here is a summation of this movie: mech fighting, screaming, and then random statements/conversations using the words reality, dreams, life, death, heart, being, etc. interchangably. I heard this was supposed to be a more coherent finale than the last two episodes of the series. Wrong. It completely devolves at the end into the randomness that was the last two episodes. I actually think I liked the first ending better for its no-holds-barred chaos, but that's not saying much. This series started out so well and then it just slowly fell apart. What is it with Japanese storylines that it can't finish logically even when it starts well? Xenogears, Final Fantasy, Akira, I've about had it. Stuff that is nonsensical at the beginning (Akira) I don't expect to make sense at the end. But this was good. For many episodes.Bah.The worst part of this movie is not the incoherent ending, but the fact that it made me wish I hadn't started watching to begin with."
1,"I bought this thinking that it would improve noise cancellation over my headset. I was a streamer at the time, and viewers complained sometimes about being able to hear me breathing, my keyboard typing, or sirens outside.This microphone was even worse, plus added awkwardness in setting up because it needed to be on a surface. I looked for solutions to quantify my purchase, but it seems the noise cancellation doesn't work for W7. I just said screw it eventually and gave it to my roommate and continued using my headset."
1,"I read romance for that - romance - and not rape, torture and sadism. It's hard to be sympathetic to a heroine who sleeps around, and repulsive to read about constant violence. What was it about this decade that made women think that in brutalization lay true love?"
1,"Had to quit buying this once I discovered it contained MSG (Monosodium Glutamate). So sad. Loved this dip, why do they have to make it so bad for you?"
1,"i'll buy this movie when it comes out in 3D until then.. no way. i really enjoyed seeing it in theaters IN 3D, so until that happens i'm sadly not buying it."
1,Photo cover detached from album and not able to reattach. Plastic screws less than 1/2 inch in length don't connect to anything. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,"I picked up this book hoping that the author recognized the glut of books with the theme of, ""Keep your chin up and you'll soon get married and live happily ever after"" and instead write a book for those who are satisfied with their lives and just looking for some advice on how to address the people and situations in life that assume you're incontent.I was sorely disappointed. They can keep the money I paid for this book, I just want my time back."
1,"I bought a vintage polaroid camera that takes this film, and was so excited to try it, until I see the film when it comes out of my camera...it has a Budweiser beer ad on it!It says Budweiser, and budweiser.com on the bottom of my film, and all around it it's blue and white. Naturally, I was very, very disappointed to see this, because polaroid pictures should be white around the edges, and you should be able to write on them.No reviews or anything said this, and nothing on the packaging mentions these ads.I DIDN'T GET THIS ON AMAZON, BUT AMAZON GUIDED ME TO THE WEBSITE.Besides the horrible ad, the film quality is pretty good, and the packaging was unopened. I don't think every film package has this, but just know that some do! I'm in the process of making paper frames to cover up the beer ad, because who wants their pictures to have a giant blue BUDWEISER ad on it. Hope this helps."
1,Although I asked 3 or 4 gamers before I bought the game whether it would play on an XP system (It was a windows 98 game) or not before I purchased; it would not load on any of the 3 computers in our home. It was the only thing my 9 year old autistic son had asked for so we went from ecstacy to tears for Christmas. I am now looking at Goodwill for an old computer that will play this game. He's a cool kid that just wants to be a Martian; and I hope at some point he will be.
1,"2 out of the 6 rolls did not have any adhesive whatsoever. It seemed like the only thing holding the Scotch ""tape"" to my packages was static cling. Embarrassingly, I had to resort to another brand of tape to secure my last few packages. Will not buy again."
1,"The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that, don't bother. This is the sad story of the product of a dysfunctional, estranged family who has many opportunities through gifts, trusts and other money sources to find his potential, get an education and make his contribution to society. Instead, through drugs, homosexuality and extreme self-absorbtion, he descends into a sad, wasted life. I regret buying this book. Again, don't bother."
1,"Based on its cover, which let's face it, is how we buy decorating books, this one looked really interesting and quite sumptuous. Unfortunately, the contents did not live up to the cover and featured rooms and ideas that are already beginning to look ""dated"". There were no ideas for creating a rich or monied decorating style and the text was rather ""homespun"". Having bought it on sale, I was very glad I hadn't paid full price; I would have been most disappointed."
1,"It was not a well written story. It didn't hold my interest. I kept waiting for something to occur. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea, yet others may find it a great book."
1,"I got this to connect my MacBook Pro to an HDTV, to no avail. When I connected it, the screen would flash blue once then refuse to detect the external display. I took the setup in to an Apple Store, where switching computers had the same effect. We then switched to their $26 Belkin DVI to HDMI cable and had everything work perfectly.Yeah, it's only a few dollars on Amazon with shipping, but it's not worth even that for Mac users - this seems to be a frequent problem."
1,"This keyboard and mouse combo came with my new computer. I've returned it once because the mouse stopped working on the 2nd day that I had been using it. Unfortunately, the replacement mouse stopped functioning a week later. I've been much happier with the Microsoft Wireless 3000 keyboard and mouse."
1,this disc is very flat.i saw it coming when Too Short got down with Jermaine Dupri.this album is nothing but a Commercial Project.it's a sad day when an Artist that has defied the Industry and done his own thing stoops to this Level.he has lost his edge&flow.
1,"This is a recent version of the ""Lathe of Heaven"", not thePBS version from the early 80's. While the first version wasa wonderfully crafted adaptaion of the original story, thisis a maudline love story that never rises above the mundane.I saw a special preview of this movie at the recent WorldSF convention. I went to see it thinking it was the same""Lathe of Heaven"" that I had seen on PBS 20 years ago. A movieso powerful that although I saw it only the once I still rememberit well. I was thrilled at the chance to see it again. I wasso very disappointed.Nothing about this is worth watching. Buy the 1980 versioninstead."
1,"Bought this phone several years ago; should have returned it at once. Sound quality is poor and by about a year later, the LCD display began flaking out. The display and the selector wheel are now both useless. Battery has already been replaced twice and is dead again."
1,"I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this product... Even with the transmitter and receiver sitting within 2 ft. of each other, pointing directly at one another, with or without anything between them, the signal is sketchy. The picture quality seems ok, when I do get a picture of signal. Any vibration in the house makes screen flicker horribly and the units do not work at all while I use my wi-fi network, portable phone, or when the microwave on the other side of the housed is being used. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Get a wired product and drill holes in the wall if you need to."
1,"People buy this book to learn how to create webpages from the beginning, and I am one of them. But after studying whole book, I still have no idea how to start my webpages. The author write a lot to let readers know computing techniques, but he doesn't write in detail how to do step by step; therefore, I have to check google and some html or css tutorial website to see how to work from my own laptop.The book even doesn't say that people have to open wordpad to start html language before launching webpages in internet. Not recommend any beginner to buy this useless book."
1,All this information is included in the Eat Right for Your Type book. So I really didn't need to buy it.
1,"I thought I was going to write a rave review of this item. It was amazingly easy to assemble without any tools needed. Unfortunately, less than a day after I assembled it, and before I hung any coats, the wood in the base cracked and the coat rack was unusable. Amazon is good with returns, but it is still a hassle to take the coat rack apart, pack it up and take it to a UPS Store. I think a metal coat rack would be a better idea."
1,"These guys must hate music. Because they are the worst. And they have paved the wave for awful bands like Nickleback. Pearl Jam is for people who just stopped listening to Jimmy Buffett and Bearnaked Ladies. And then they decided to move on. These songs contained here are the worst ever. And Pearl Jam is the worst ever. I laugh when I listen to these songs...are you seroius. Yes. They are and that is what makes it even worse. All of the songs seemed forced. Like an eighth grader wrote it for the talent show at summer camp. This music is detached from nature and is false. Even 10, looking back is some pretty gawd awful stuff...But there are Pearl Jam fans. And they love thier Jam. And who am I to say. I know some of them and they are nice people. But when it come down to music...There is just no talking to them...Check out some other ""rock"" bands out there...and explore your world.Don't sit in the mud..."
1,I ordered two of these and neither one would charge or power on. I loved the fit and the choice of the over-the-ear pieces but I never got a chance to test the earpieces because they never worked. I'm returning them for a refund tomorrow. I don't even want an exchange.
1,"I really liked this book, but there were a few stupid parts. I mean, when Cassie saved the kid from a bear? The kid swinging by her fingertips from a tree, and Cassie grabbing her while on the horse is like something from a cheap movie. Also, I would have written the ending...well, just plain cooler. I would have had the Ellimist tell Cassie to go ahead and morph the caterpillar and tell her how she would be able to morph out. Then she would have became a butterfly, and demorphed and walked into school, and have Jake, Rachel, and Marco freaking out. That would be cool."
1,"I buy a lot of books. In general I average about $600/year in books. I hold an MSEE and an MBA. So I buy a lot of business and technical books.This is the first time that I feel that a book I baught was so worthless that I felt it my duty to write about it.Sometimes it is hard to keep voluminous books about a particular area. So I thought I could buy a condensé that just reminds me what I need to remember if need be.Well, I got the wrong book. This is the lowest level book I have come across and I am surprised it's writen by so called ""eminent"" professors and endorsed by so called ""Harvard business school"" professors.A blunt breach of credibility for those who wrote this leaflet and those who endorsed it."
1,"Green Day Was My Favorite Band!!American Idiot wasn't that goodBullet in a bible is horrible...As Green Day gets older, They SUCK!!!Billie Joe Had A MUCH MUCH MUCH better voice when he was younger!UGH!!!"
1,"I purchased my modem, received it after 2 weeks. It worked fine for about a month then just stopped working. I thought it was Comcast but it wasn't. So, I emailed Digital Media to let them know my one month old modem is bad. Their response, ""Call Motorola"" LOL. No phone number, no suggestions and it took them 3 days to email THAT! AND... when I took my modem in...I FOUND OUT IT WAS A REFURB MODEM!!!! NOWHERE on the item page did it even mention this modem being a refurb!!!!! WATCH OUT!!"
1,"This is just a 23 year old version of Make the Most of Your Money.You can definitely skip this one, unless you like antiques without value."
1,"Había visto buenos comentarios, sin embargo, cuando me llego el producto, e intente instalarlo en mi casco (Giro), me fue imposible es muy corto el ""poste"" y me fue imposible lograr fijarlo, se cae en todo momento."
1,This is the second 210C I have owned. This is the second 210C I have damaged beyond repair due to anger. These machines are very tempermental regarding the ink. The machine will state the ink is empty when there is ink in the cartridge. It also does not like off brank inks. I love the interface and functions of this machine and that is why I bought the 2nd one. There will not be a 3rd. Insult to injury - they denied my rebate submission. Go ahead and buy one of these and test your level of control.
1,"Sorry to say, its not worth the money. Some very old illustrations. I would be ashamed to charge this amount of money for such little substance."
1,". . . and take this stinking movie with you. I should have known better, but I'd heard that this was the first movie filmed in high definition, so I wanted to see how it looked. WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE CRAP! AND IT SOUNDED LIKE CRAP! BECAUSE IT IS CRAP! The DVD doesn't even have any menu extras - that's how bad this movie is. Not that a spoof reel would have saved the film, but at least it would have been appropriate. This is without a doubt the worst presmell of all time. If you value your soul, as well as your wallet, then stay away. Far away."
1,I had accidentally bought this thinking it was the clan GAME book like it had been advertised as. My bad. >_<
1,Does not work like advertised. Ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again. It may also damage a wood or aluminum bat. Last time I buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon.
1,I purchased this as a reference for my masters thesis. In 2007/2008 it was really out of date and can really only be referenced for the early stages of distance learning.
1,"Bought the Dorman pump thinking the quality was good but I was wrong. I received the pump and tested it before installing it; the pump was extremely noisy so I exchanged it. I received the second pump and this one is noisy too but not as much as the first one, so I decided to give it a chance and installed it. It works fine but it is noisy, now I have a noisy car.If you can afford to buy a good quality pump then don't bother with this one, you will not be happy. lots of room for improvement or the price shall be reduced significantly. I don't recommend the Dorman pump."
1,"Useless, barely gets warm on highest settings. Have own total of 5 and only 2 works... Sunbeam avoid they make cheap products and does not stand behind their warranty!"
1,"I really enjoy MJD's Vampire series, which is why I purchsed this book. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This is very poorly written, probably in a few days. The main character of the first story is obnoxious and unlikable. The sex scenes don't seem as if a woman wrote them at all. The plot lines are thin. All in all the worst book I have read in many years. If I could give this zero stars I would."
1,"I own two of McBrien's books (Catholicism & Encyclopedia). They look very serious on Catholicism, but they are NOT. They contain a lot of McBrien's thoughts about what should be Catholicism.

1,Save your money. This is a dishonest company.I bought this pillow for years. Then in Sept i bought three to keep for awhile and they all came in so soft and unusable. I contacted the company immediately but they refused to return my money. Master card has been fighting them for nine months to get me money mo ey back. I even spent my own money to send it back to them. So I have been out $60.
1,"I brought this book on vacation to Italy - and left it there when I was done. It was that bad. The story is like a bad romance novel - very predictable and stereotypical. I didn't really like any of the characters, and the author seemed to be trying too hard to squeeze in too much stuff - the wonders and selflessness of volunteering, the Hollywood scene, and way too many mental health troubles. Sheesh. I had hopes as I neared the end that something might happen to wrap everything up, but no. It would have been more surprising and interesting if the reporter hadn't fallen in love with the celebrity, or if something had come of the chief of staff's shenanigans. I won't be recommending this book to friends, and I don't think I'll seek out any of the author's other books."
1,"Let's face it, Moore is an angry Socialist and his ""shtick"" is getting tiresome. I'll admit that it was funny watching him chase Roger around the Generally Mediocre (GM) headquarters, but this latest installment of angry uberliberal is just 200+ pages of leftwing conspiracy theories, outright lies and some interesting ""interpretations"" of events. All of this would be OK if it were funny, but in the end it comes off as the bitter ramblings of a guy pining for the good old days when Bubba ran the show and who now is still bitter because Bubba's sidekick the human tree himself Al Gore didn't win the election."
1,"A lot of build up for very little pay off. The idea of meeting a future version of oneself is ripe with possibilities, but this film just doesn't get there. Levitt is great though and his performance makes his young Willis more believable, even though the make up is a bit distracting."
1,"Sorry Mr. Koonz, but I'll take my religious lessons somewhere else besides a so called thriller novel. Great beginning as well as some scary moments but far too preachy for me. I'll be sure to read the reviews a little more carefully on future Koonz novels before purchasing."
1,"because I really didn't think it was good at all. First of all, it's boring. The first time I tried to watch it, I feel asleep. Second of all, I wasn't impressed at all by the acting. the only character I thought was believable was Merlin--and admittedly the Merlin of EXCALIBUR is one of my favorite portrayals of him--but his scenes with Morgana were just ridiculous. I didn't care for the fantasy land she trapped him in at all. And, speaking or Morgana, I know this is trite, but she is just not convincing with blond hair! Plus, she was too much like a dominatrix or something in this film. I know she's supposed to be evil, but she was pretty anachronistic in this portrayal. Overall I'd say, if you want a good film portrayal of the Arthurian legends, your best bet is the Mists of Avalon, the TNT miniseries."
1,Why is this the only book in the series I'm not able to read electronically? This is a nasty trick. Amazon needs to explain...
1,"I can't reveiw this product because I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET!!! WHERE IS MY PRODUCT??? I ORDERED THIS BEFORE CHRISTMAS - IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BY NOW. I AM ONLY PUTTING ONE ""STAR"" ON THIS REVEIW BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T LET ME SEND IT WITHOUT THAT ONE ""STAR"" - BUT I WOULD HAVE NOT CHECKED ANY STAR IF I COULD."
1,Company is out of business and left previous owners hanging. Bias uses challenge and responce authorization and when they close down the web site you are SOOL.
1,"I picked up this book because the premise sounded interesting. I wasn't expecting great literature; just a fun, summer read. But after only two pages, I was already cringing in my seat. Maybe the writing lost something in the translation -- one can only hopes so. Regardless, it was stilted and self-conscious, the sort of thing one reads in a freshman writing class. I slogged through about 50 pages, but finally had to give up. There's only so much pain a person can take in the name of an interesting premise."
1,Hitler used similar film methods in 1930s to rile up the youth of Germany. Lies and more lies twist the mind of the youth while thundering music plays behind vivid scenes. Take some time to look at the Hitler movies and you will see uncanny parallels to Moore's style. The means justify the ends. The ends are questionable.
1,"I bought When Harry Hit The Hamptons as a beach book for my vacation. I wasn't expecting Hemmingway, but was hoping for some light entertainment. Unfortunately, just within a few pages, I realized that this is a lost cause. Ms. Goodman-Davies's characters are absurd. No one talks the way Harry or Penny or Jessica talk, unless they are brain-damaged. And I am at a loss of words when it comes to how the character Juan speaks. I doubt that the author has ever talked to or knew a Spanish-speaking person.The character Harry uses the words ""dude"" and ""man"" excessively, because he is from Los Angeles. And the author's endless references to ""JAPs"" and ""WASPs"" were truly nauseating. Finally the sexual situations were so juvenile that they can only be written by a teenage boy whose only source for sexual knowledge is Playboy.All in all, a total waste of time and money...even for a beach book."
1,"This product arrived completely dried out. The glue had apparently been exposed to air, and was unable to be used at all. This is the second product from Pioneer that I had bought, and will not make this mistake again."
1,"When I first started reading this book I was very much encouraged to see his accounting for gravitational time dilation. Then I realized he got it backward. A clock ticks slower in a gravitational field, so time on earth is 24 hours and ticking of a clock at the edge of an expanding universe is much much faster, billions of years. The author is a Day Ager. This theory is in error both theologically and scientifically. The days of Genesis are not long ages of time, they are 24hrs of earth time. How could someone of such intelligence and learning get it backward and be so confusing on this subject?"
1,why why why did you sell out blink 182? you were so cool in earlier albums such as chesire cat and buddha. Now you've completely lost your little punk-rockishness and have become pop. WHY?!? Don't buy this album unless you like pop. If your a diehard blink 182 fan then download it somewhere. Dont waste your money. This CD is over-editted and only has 2 or 3 decent songs. Please go back to making real punk rock Blink 182. Stop trying to pass off this ...(stuff) as punk. No punk fan should buy this.
1,"There was more hard science SF here than is typical of Star Trek novels, and the authors clearly know their science. BUT: They are not very good writers, the characters are cardboard cut-outs, the plot is thin, the philosophy is weak, and the ending is trite. Not recommended except for the collector who has to have every ST novel."
1,"Having redone our kitchen we decided to upgrade our coffee machine. Well,looks great, but function is pretty poor and does not froth well. I unfortunately have to agree with all the other negative comments left about this product, its a shame I did not read them prior to my purchase. Now to go and do the D.D. on other coffee makers BEFORE I purchase. Click past this particular coffee maker...."
1,"Just a word to the wise. Lynne Meredith was convicted of Failure to file income taxes, and other charges in Federal District Court in Los Angeles in May 2004.This book was part of the trial evidence that convicted her."
1,My 10 year old thought this was really dumb - how can you really be a spy with lights shinning from the lenses? It's really just a headlamp with green tinted goggles.
1,"I bought this along with a large humidifier. I was concerned about the bacteria and minerals in my water. I live in an area with extremely hard water. But about ten minutes after I put this chemical in the humidifier water, I started to get a headache and my husband started complaining of a sore throat. It made my house smell like a public pool (it smelled like chlorine). And after I read the warning labels on the back, I decided to just throw it out. It has warnings about not getting it on your skin or eyes and not breathing it. How are you supposed to not breathe it if you put it in your humidifier? It even had warnings about making sure the cap was on tight when you stored the bottle to prevent fumes from escaping. With that many warnings, I decided it was safer to throw out the chemicals and just clean my humidifier more often."
1,"Yeah It's changed all right..I guess MONEY does change everything. Long are the days of the creative singer songwriter that used to give a damm about his art. Now it's obvious that he can throw any `ol [junk] out without caring about if people will like it or not..He's made his Billions (and it shows). And most disturbing to me is not having made the slightest reference to the Attack on Sept. 11th, you'd think he would have some gratitude to the people who made him a success. My hat goes off to Neil Young."
1,"Ok, Simple Plan, is simply don't buy it. They may play their own instruments, but that doesn't mean they are great. Their album names are lame and not creative at all. it sucks, really. there are so many other bands out there to listen too. i don't seem enthralled with this band, i don't think they have much to work with. also they play on TRL so much, which is not such a acomplishment. They aren't really that 'punk-rock'.. come on. with those dumb titles?! really, get serious. real punk rockers would puke all over this. they'd be ashamed. if you like them, well you do, but i sure don't. check out other bands, and maybe you'll find this CD, eventually.. getting to the back of that shelf of yours."
1,"I should have picked up on this from the reviews, and the award from Kids First, but I didn't. My low rating is for adults, or even older kids. Other reviewers liked it, so it might be fine for kids 8 or 9 and under, but the card tricks are really lame for anyone else. Be advised that this DVD is FOR KIDS ONLY."
1,My son was crying tonight because he couldn't open his safe and get out his valuables. I tried repeatedly and could not also. I tried googleing the company to see if there is a release somewhere but I cannot even find the company on the web. Save your child heartache. Do not buy this.
1,"I ordered what was supposed to be a new copy of a tv series on dvd. However, the box was damaged and all 5 discs had scratches on them. The scratches did not allow us to watch the movie. I got my product very promptly, but didn't know about this issue for 2 months because it was a Christmas present. I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want to take the chance on getting something that is fake but still usable, go for it. But I personally wouldn't use this seller again."
1,"I would have rated less than a full star, but it wouldn't let me. I Did not receive the item I ordered! It was completely different. Tried to contact seller with NO response. Went through Amazon to get a resolution & apparently seller didn't respond to them either because Amazon just notified me that they would issue me a refund for my purchase. This was a Christmas gift, which I was embarrassed to find that it was the wrong item. It said #8 Dale JR, but they sent #3 Dale SR. Terrible customer service!!! Would NOT recommend ordering from them. UNresponsive."
1,"Though this book seems like a nice collection of quotes related to the art of the being present, it does not bring any meaningful teaching on its own. In fact, this book was really done by one of Robert Burton's devoted student who did the research on her own while the cult leader Robert Burton was sexually abusing his students. Over the lifetime of the cult, it is well-known that Robert Burton had sex with well over 1000 heterosexual men against their will claiming it is a necessary step towards enlightment. This delusional man sees himself as a Goddess in a man's body and leaves a luxurious lifestyle while he pumps all the money he can from his followers. Though a charismatic leader with naive followers, his intellectual abilities are quite limited. Now at 70, he organizes frequent group sex with men. If you are curious to meet a psychopath, make sure to join his cult."
1,"Rotozip SUCKSthe high hard one...the low limp onebasically anything you put before it , it will suckThe ONLY use I have ever found for this piece of junkin for carving pumpkins...which actually it does really wellonce you develop your technique for controlling it. But it willnot serve anyone well for cutting anytihing more than gyp board andcertainly will not perform as the commercials infer."
1,"Beth Moore doesn't know what to do with the OT. She discovers a few moralisms (""life lessons"") and a few spiritual principles, but she does not understand covenant or the Christ centered nature of OT revelation.Although she is aware that some see Joseph as a symbol of Christ, she rejects the idea. She sees him as self centered, emotionally conflicted, out of control, a liar and a drunk.Beth Moore is a great entertainer but not a good Bible teacher. I would not recommend this book."
1,"I just ripped this CD onto my computer using Real Jukebox. After I did, and played a few tracks for the first time in years, I was sorely tempted to just erase the files, even though I have 15 Gig left on my drive. Yes, the album is that bad. The only reason I'm holding onto this CD is in the hope it goes out of print - then I can sell it for $... on eBay. Meanwhile, it makes a great toy for my 1-1/2 year old. And who the hell is this Pete Bellotte that wrote the ... on this CD? I sure hope it wasn't a pen name for Elton John. I like early 80's Elton more than his other phases - The Fox, 21 at 33, Too Low For Zero are all great in my book. If you like those, stay far, far away from this one."
1,It's just a bunch of phony sound effects that you could download free anywhere on the net. It's a total scam. I wasted my money and might put it on eBay or something to try and make something back. It's total garbage.
1,"This is NOT COMPATIBLE with other great devices like my Sony Ericsson S710a cell phone, my eMac, or my newest G4 iBook Macintosh. I can make and receive calls, but why would I purchase a pair of headphones just to talk on the phone. I can't listen to music or movies for jack and am very disappointed with my purchase.I will never purchase or consider Motorola a high end product EVER AGAIN!"
1,"I had to use this book for a college course in East Asian Studies. I have to say this is not a very enjoyable book to read, especially for writing a research paper. The author tends to ramble, jumping from topic to topic within sentences, and uses inflated language, which is often unnecessary and makes you doze off in minutes.For my paper, I ended up looking into other books which helped me greatly. Do not read the first review for this book - it's most likely a professor who uses this book in one of his courses. Believe me, ""lost in translation"" is just skimming the surface when speaking about this book. Hope that helps."
1,"I am extremely disappointed in this phone. Only because of Verizon and how they have disabled the many features that this phone has to offer. My boyfriend and I brought this phone roughly 30 days apart only to find that the software on his allowed him to download ringtones, pictures, etc. utilizing a transfash. Well, I went out and purchased a transflash as well but quickly found out that I couldn't transfer the files to the new software that is now installed on my phone. Bottom line is if you have the older software you can enjoy this V710 but if you have the newer software FORGET it. I wish that as a consumer there is something that we can do about this misleading options on this phone. I only wish I could return the phone. I truly don't think that what Verizon has done is legal. If anyone has figured out a way to get around their many disabled features, please let me know."
1,"i watched this with my friends because I hadn't seen a new movie for a long time, as I am a classic film fan (pre-1955) and i think this movie is pretty terrible. it's worse than Reefer Madness (1936). read the book instead. the one star is for the very 1940's style. i loved it. but this movie made me glad i like classics, because ""Black Dahlia"" is a very unwholsome movie about a time when Hollywood made nice, wholsome movies. sad to see that the quality of movies have gone down so much in the past 50/45 years, and this picture is proof of that. i mean, come on, i'm a kid and even i know that films today are getting worse and worse and that's why the theaters aren't as packed!"
1,"I do owe Jim Patterson much credit for my new passion for reading. While taking care of my ill mother, I began reading to deal with some insomnia I was having. I read When the Wind Blows and admit... I enjoyed it. From there, went on to read all the Dan Brown books and some Grishim offerings. I decided to give the Lake House a try thinking it might be fun to revisit the bird clan. Oh God Help Me! This was such a bad read. I really don't understand the entire product placement inserts (M&M's, Nellie, Mountain Dew etc.) it was painful. There is something troubling about reading from the point of view of a 12-year girl and know it's coming from the experiences of a 60+ year old man. In fact, parts of this book don't seem like Patterson wrote it at all. Someone should have told him kids today simply don't act nor speak the way they do in this book. He should end the series here. It's done."
1,"I hate this CD , it was waste of money and I wish I could refund my money ( 89 USD + S&H, I bough it directly from the publisher) I am absolutly agree with the rest of the reviewers. questions are not even close to USMLE step 2 format. whoever wrote those questions I am sure that had no idea about USMLE at all since the questions are about any thing but USMLE step 2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CD 7 insted try to read NMS REVIEW multiple Q ( it is bible of USMLE step 2 )."
1,"To begin with this cage is falsely misrepresented as being 24x22x63 when it is actually 22x22x63. If you are not mechanicaly inclined the instructions will mean nothing to you as they are jibberish. If you complain to the company they tell you to send it back at your expense and they will refund your money, or they offer you a 25% discount to not write a bad review on them. Needless to say I declined their 25%!!!!! I have had my African Grey in an Avian cage for twenty plus years and thought it would be nice to treat him to a new cage, BIG MISTAKE!!! I have since had the Avian cage sandblasted and powercoated and gave this piece of junk away."
1,"The Suunto Clipper Micro Compass is not accurate or reliable. It consistently failed to point in the proper direction which renders it completely useless. I repeatedly tested its accuracy against other compasses and it continually failed to point in the correct direction.When it comes to utilization of a compass reliability is a significant factor and this compass is not reliable. In addition, it is made of plastic and is easily breakable.I do not recommend this compass."
1,"I thought this puppet would really sing the songs. Instead it makes a somewhat irratating noise for each note. If you don't know what song it is ""singing"", it doesn't sound right because you have to know the beat or rhythm of the song. I have purchased a dog about a year ago that sings a love song by the Carpenters when you move the mouth it sings a phrase at a time. I guess I had different expectations for this little cat.On the Pros side - it is cute and a durable toy."
1,These finger sleeves are terrible. They do not hold up well at all. I got them for an arthritic finger and wore it to work one day(Letter Carrier). The fabric lost its elasticity after about 3 hrs work and the stitching came loose on both ends.
1,"The promotion of this film was better than the film. Once you get past the first half dozen or so random killings and the deadpan acting, the rest is even worse. The idea that the film is sending some sort of insightful message about random violence is without merit. After about the first 10 minutes anyone with an IQ above about 30 should figure out random violence is bad and by the way have you noticed random violence is bad? Save your time, save your money and just watch the news.Random violence is bad. Wow what an insight!This film is evidence of how far the standards for films has fallen in the industry."
1,"The paint on this began to chip within minutes of my toddler daughter playing it, and the toy was made in China. Now I'm worried that it might have been lead-based paint."
1,"I work at a foundry where we have to cut ceramic tiles to various lengths when putting sand molds together. I bought this blade based on the manufacturer's claim that its life will be 350x longer than conventional ceramic saw blades. Not true. It did not even last as long as one of the blades we normally use (""Norton"" brand that we buy from Home Depot for $6.27 each). Fortunately, I did not pay regular price for this blade -- I'm only out $49.00 plus shipping. Let the buyer beware: this blade does not measure up to the claims made by the manufacturer."
1,"Absolutely 'unlistenable'!!!If this was recorded by Minnie to impress Mickey then I suppose it wouldn't be all that bad, if not...then, ooh my, what an embarrassment to all involved!The nasality with which this lady performs will probably serve her well if she chooses a career as a voiceover artist in the world of animation...and even those roles will be somewhat limited!If this is a sample of the full length cd to come...that will probably be the ONLY full length cd to come from this...uh...'singer'!'Summertime' USE to be one of all time favorite songs!!!"
1,"It sure is a shame that a legacy which has been built on such an ardent fan base would have to be tarnished by the unwillingness to listen.. No Lucas, you are not bigger than your fan base.. get real and listen! Poeple want the ORIGINAL versions; and yes, if you must, throw in the butchered releases too."
1,"The Titor Saga began at TimeTravelInstitute.com where John Titor first posted and it ultimately leads to Celebration, Florida. Now Time Travel Institute itself leads to Celebration, Florida.Celebration Florida is ""all Disney"" and both TimeTravelInstitute and Magical Mouse lead back to Disney Corp. This evidence has caused Timetravelinstitute.com Webmaster Raul Burrier to state that he knows who John Titor really is but refuses to give his identity. Now many people believe that timetravelinstitute.com was set up purely for the hoax and the webmaster of the site was involved somehow.The John Titor foundation attorney Larry Haber and his son Brandon Haber are both linked to Celebration, Florida, The Book, the Radio Promo, Coffee Mugs, T-shrts, etc. All these different men being linked to Celebration, FL really is a strange coincidence.Having a time traveller story that does not ask for money would add credibility - even better for a forum."
1,"The 60's are gone, long gone..... We have all moved on, hopefully... Apparently some of us have not.... I was sorry to have wasted all that time reading what turned out to be a very typical, and not particularly entertaining, story of teenage angst."
1,"Regardless of what the Amazon listing says (and I asked them to change it over a month ago and still haven't) this product is NOT weatherproof. When you open the package the literature about the product specifically states that it is ""not for use outdoors"". You have to pay more to get a weatherproof model."
1,"Made my testicles hurt after u packages. May hve been just me , but i stopped taking them after day 2"
1,"I bought this book because the name was appealing and I thought it would be useful for my job on a help desk. There are more pictures than real information and I've found much better troubleshooting tips on newsgroups and in other books. The concept of this book is good and I want to like it, but it just doesn't deliver. Perhaps it would be useful for someone with little Microsoft Office experience."
1,"Honestly - this title ought to be removed from every list of serious retailers, it's a fraud in many senses! The whole show looks like some provincial amateur staging. I cannot judge the music, because the copies are such poor quality in picture and sound that one can barely notice that there's a musical score at all... Copyright issue: even the producer's trailermusic is stolen from another filmcompany! The only star goes out for the best phantom makeup I've ever seen. To every Phantom phan out there: don't touch this one, ""or a desaster beyond your imagination will occur""!"
1,I cannot believe this is the work of Mr. Sheldon. Most of his earlier books were filled with suspense and many twists and turns of the plot. This was way below par and very predictable; I was very disappointed. I see Mr. Sheldon is scheduled to be on A&E's Biography tonight (1/18/00) - I wonder if he will apologize to his longtime readers for this trashy work? As another reviewer suggests perhaps he has just run out of ideas. It's very sad to see that he has come to this.
1,"The first part of the movie wasn't bad... then they did any thing for a cheep laugh, and they didn't even get any. The Plot if there was one was nothing but throwing things in and making fun of them. The first one was original and funny, but how many times do you really wanna see a guy smoke...or watch a million jokes about guy's... I want my money back!"
1,"I got the cartoon becouse the cover of the movie looked good and becouse Charlton Heston was on it. but the Video was far from the truth of what the bible says.... It is innacurate and can mislead children. i shut the video off and did not finish the cartoon. i am very dissapointed!!. the person i got the video from gave me good service and it was brand new and i recieved it very fast. thats the only thing good. Besides that. i was left with my mouth open the whole time in disbelief!!. Horrible whoever put this together.. i dont think they know the story of creation correctly at all!! as for charlton Heston, he was either tricked, or he is just strictly a good man and i give him credit as far as the movie TEN COMMANDMENTS goes. Thats all i have to say... But please, Avoid this movie for your childrens sake. Thank you"
1,This movie is the worst ever! I tried to go to sleep when I was in the theatre watching it. Do not buy it! I highly recommended AGAINST it!
1,Huge disappointment. The drawers do not stay shut and just flop open when the box is moved even slightly. Considering the size of the box there is actually very little storage. Poor sound quality. Just overall a really bad product.
1,"Yes, Fair Game is that bad. With a cast headed by William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford, the acting will be at best atrocious, and when things are bad, it can get unwatchable. The action scenes are of decent choreography, but it doesn't generate any excitement. Considering the hoary material involved, that's basically sticking a fork into this movie."
1,"The saddest part of the saga of Star Wars is that future generations will never know what the original imagined story looked like. The Yoda we grew up with is now gone thanks to this edition; having been replaced with the fake computer graphic that infected the 3 prequels. It's bad enough that Darth was replaced with Hayden Christensen (a change that didn't even make sense considering neither Yoda or Ben appeared as their young selves)but this new remake replaces a lot of what made the original Star Wars so cool. Had Lucas allowed the original version to be an option alongside his remake, this wouldn't be an issue."
1,"Junk straight out of the box...parts break, misalign; and customer service is NO help....save yourself some time, money, and aggravation; find another suitable product."
1,These were a waste of money. They dogs hated the taste and refused to take them. Would not recommend this product
1,I remember this game as a game i used to play at the arcade when i was younger. I was never aware that it was sold for the Nintendo deck as well. I was so happy to come across it in my search for oler Nintendo games. When i recieved it i found that it has really bad graphics even for an 8-bit game. It is very hard to control the charachter as he always gets stuck when climbing stairs and other obstacles. The arcade version was one of my all time favorites. I spent many hours and a good portion of my allowance playing the arcade version. But i dont recommend this version of the game to anyone.
1,"Stupid, Ignorant movie. I can't believe I wasted my time or money on this one. The only women were the whore/dancer, the girl who gave it up on the first date and the sister who was a slut anyway...not a decent woman in the movie. The guys had one thing only on their minds. Just stupid, plain stupid. Maybe you have to be a stupid guy to like this?"
1,This sorry modem has never connected above 16k and gives me a 3comlink.exe fail error whenever I disconnect. I'll take the rebate when it comes but this piece of junk is already in the circular file. Avoid USR products.
1,"I loved Genesis back in the day. I heard one of the pieces from this cd tonight on the local classical station. Earthlight. At first I thought, this is okay, kind of lightweight, but okay. Then it began to shift in tone, melody: Vaughn Williams one minute, Claude Debussy the next ... no development, no reason for things to change ... kind of the worst aspect of new age music repeated over and over. I have no idea what Tony Banks involvement with the cd is ... but this music is just a bunch of pretty wanking ..."
1,"Amazing! A typical C-student's last-minute make-up paper!Knowing nothing but pretending to know everything. I love you.The right sub-title must be one of the followings:1, For pre-school kids;2, For high-school drop-out;3, For those who know English only but absolutely nothing elseI believe Amazon should have negative rating!"
1,"I caould not get this to work on our DVD player. It just stopped working and showed a green screen. Then I could not get the DVD player to respond to turn it off! It took several times of turning the DVD player on and off to get it to release the DVD. I then tried it on our XP computer. I got it to at least play the game....for a while. Then when picking cases, it would only let me pick cases up to 13. Then it just got stuck on pick a case. What a piece of crap!! My husband is returning it as I am typing this review. Save your money!"
1,"If you are a true Foreigner fan, and want to stay that way, then don't buy this terrible DVD. I can't believe the band would allow themselves to be remembered this way. Lou Gram is one of my all time favorite vocalists, Long Hard Look, Ready Or Not, master pieces. I couldn't stand to watch the whole DVD, and watch these guys destroy the fond memories I had of the group. I never thought I would think or say it, but their washed up, time to retire."
1,"Don't buy this set, it is only the theatrical cut! Come on New Line, there is no excuse for separate editions this time. As soon as the extended editions are available I'll be ordering it, but not this set."
1,"I recently got a Vx and what a disappointment! It is not upgradable. The recharger is expensive if you want one at the office. There is no backup, so if the battery goes dead you lose all your data. It comes with bare bones software and the add-ons are expensive. I quickly used up the 8 MB of memory and now I have to discard this one and buy something that better suits my needs. Don't waste your money on this one. Other brands have more to offer."
1,I ordered this book in September and have yet to receive it! The sellers have not answered any of the emails sent and now I am out the money. Never buy from this seller!

1,"This book is fine if you're preaching to the choir. Any intelligent person can see through it in a minute. Read a little Dennis McKinsey. Much of his stuff is free on the net, but he has two books out. He blows Archer's arguments away like lint."
1,My solaris broke after using it two times. The first time was to drill two holes in drywall. The second time was to clean out tile joints for grouting. I wouldn't recommend buying one.
1,"I bought this for my husband, he couldn't use it because of its unpractical design..."
1,does anyone know what the name of the song is that is played at the begining when sebastian is in the cab?
1,"After spending about 10 hours playing this monstrosity it bacame clear to me that the era of the Playstation2 is done. I packed up my PS2 and dozens of games and got what little value in trade-in that I could to switch to XBox and I couldn't be happier. Basically, this lame game was the mitigating factor to switch.All you do in killzone is run through levels that are so similar from one another it's stupid. There is no variety whatsoever in the enemies, and that really is the main problem. It's just wave after wave of the same dudes in black saying the same phrases over and over in their deep voices.Oh yeah, it takes at least 5 to 6 head shots to down an average Helghast-it's so fake. The story is lame, the graphics are fair but just as dull as everything else on the game. I guarantee you that not once will you find yourself thinking ""that was a cool effect"", or ""how'd they do that?"". This game is the perfect cure for insomnia, however. Trust me and [...]. Horrible."
1,"I'm not that impressed with this coffee maker at all. I initially bought it because of the promise of keeping the coffee hot. What I experienced with the first one I bought was that it leaked - at the bottom of the water holder, there is a plastic plug that fell out and went down the drain - then it wouldn't hold water. I purchased another one and the plastic plug fell out again, fortunately, grabbed it before it went down the drain. The handle on the basket broke and the timer/clock function stopped working the first week. After several months, I have to press the button several times to get it to complete one cycle of making a full pot. As time went on, sometimes I would get a hot cup of coffee, sometimes, I wouldn't and I'm finding it's taking longer and longer to brew. It's going in the garbage and I'm going back to my Mr. Coffee Maker."
1,"I have been a long time, and very satisfied, user of Dell PC's and laptops. The 1710 was my first Dell printer.Out of the box the first one failed. Would not print. All five status lights blinking; LONG time on the phone with India following the standard script. Unable to resolve. Dell sent a replacement printer.The replacement one worked for a few weeks, then the very same problem. Dell sent another replacment.Eight months later the same problem; yet another replacement.Nine months later the fourth one failed with the same identical problem. Out of warranty now. This one is going to the dump. It is the last Dell printer i will ever buy"
1,"I was determined to finish the entire book, and I did...finally. The details are what got me. There was not much of a story, so the author had to fill the book with details. Loading the dishwasher, cleaning the cabinets, the damn ants in the mailbox. Who cares? Where is the story? The family was annoying: Kenneth who couldnt follow through on a single project he wanted to do, Margaret fighting for the house until she realized she could get money instead, Emily so wrapped up in the mundane details of day to day chores because she has nothing better to do. It was really hard for me to follow these people through a day, let alone an entire week. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"I had the TV for 3 years, I did enjoy it. But it stopped working today. Why can't TV's work longer then 3 years? Such a waste of labor and material."
1,"This film is self-defeated by two opposing currents: it's much too silly and poorly acted to be taken seriously, much too sad and brutal to be considered good campy fun. I don't know what effect the makers were shooting for, but suffice to say that their aim was off by miles."
1,I purchased one earlier that lasted for years. This one is very flimsy and already breaking apart in the center. Very poor quality.
1,"Having lived in southern West Virginia for nearly 50 years, I find this work to be insulting to the people of southern West Virginia. The Lights must have looked long and hard to find places with the appalling conditions that have been depicted in this book. Granted, the economy of West Virginia is not stellar, but the majority of its citizens and its communities are not represented in this book. Yes, this state has been shaped by its coal heritage, but it has not been destroyed by it. Southern West Virginia still struggles, but not to the extent implied in these photographs. Those seeking a more accurate portrayal of life in coal communities should look elsewhere, or, better yet, visit and see for themselves."
1,"I finally bought the nintendo monopoly and the first thing I notice when I open the box is that the Master's Sword is labeled as Zelda's sword.Yes, it belong to Zelda's family but IT'S NOT ZELDA'S SWORD. IT'S LINK'S SWORD! I SWEAR!! If the company knows nothing about nintendo, why make it?! Seriously!!"
1,"I've got all IAN MOORE releases and loved everything he has done until this offering. MODERNDAY FOLKLORE and ALL THE COLORS were excellent and intelligent changes in direction, while still maintaining the obvious skills and energy from his BLUES persona. This is like EMO dross.....LEONARD COHEN without the humor. There is not even a tiny bit of energy to be found anywhere on this disc. If IAN still plays the guitar, it sure is not obvious to this listener. Not sure which drug you'd need to take to make this dirge sound good. Crying shame for one so obviously talented as IAN MOORE. I am also still listening to find the INTELLIGENT bit that some reviewers are referring to. PRETENTIOUS - YES - WANKING - YES - FLACID - YES - INTELLIGENT - NO !!!"
1,"Oh, what a disappointment to an Elinor Glyn fan! Glyn literally invented many of the romantic conventions we see in books today. Her sense of humor and sharp critical eye enliven what might otherwise be rather standard love stories.But here, most of what is truly extraordinary about Glyn has been edited out. The resut is a standard, cut-to-the-chase love story that could have been written by almost anyone. If you are interested in writing your own romance novel, this might be interesting as a study in how to move the plot along, but personally, I read in order to read good writing.And, incidentally, the work in question was not listed as being a sharply edited version. So be careful -- one can only conclude that the reader is supposed to know magically that the Barbara Cartland reissues have been chopped to pieces."
1,"I bought this blanket a year ago. When I first used it...it worked fine...I carefully packed it away for the summer. Now winter is here again, put it on the bed...and no heat what so ever....I will never buy Sunbeam again...."
1,"I was in the 1st Mar. Div. - 5th Mar. Regiment. and ""landed"" on New Guinea, New Britain, Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Okinawa, and China.Perhaps Okinawa was much the longest and fiercest battle of them all, with the most casualties the 1st Marine Division received, anywhere. In reading the book it seems that the 1ST MARINE DIVISION, 5TH REGIMENT - - (that's ""5th MARINES""), - WASN'T EVEN THERE!! ` Maybe they were dreaming!!"
1,"This battery charger had a short in the wiring. The plug didn't even fit all the way into the base. Didn't anybody test this product before they started selling them?My money was refunded, minus the shipping & handling both ways. So I'm out $20 for the s&h.;I should've gone to my neighborhood Fry's Electronics instead."
1,"I have had a racoon problem for years. I decided to buy a cage and chose this model. I received it yesterday and took it out of the box last night about 9:00pm. This morning I found a juvenile racoon in there. He had somehow removed the handle (pictures of destruction are on description), though there is a guard around it. He had also bent some of the wires on the cage. Needless to say I am returning it. This is extremely cheaply made.PETA people: I let the racoon go in a field near my work after he feasted in my garbage can."
1,"This product, and others by VPX, have so much artificial sweetener in it that it tastes disgusting. I tried cutting it with coco power and coffee to add some bitterness to try and reduce the overwhelming sweetness, and it was still way too sweet. Is it a protein powder or a candy replacement product? Tastes like pure sugar and I feel sick after drinking it. After a week I can't stand it anymore, it's going in the trash.On the label it states no aspartame or acesulfame K, that's great. But instead they use Sucralose which is another artificial sweetener that has safety concerns."
1,"Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are identical. The book is missing the real Chapter 1, so I feel that it is a big ripoff. The typography is amateurish (typewriter quotes, no real long dashes, a blank line between every paragraph--what is this, a business letter?). This is evidently a publisher that knocks together books that are in the public domain without the least attention to quality. I can't believe they charge so much for so little."
1,"This movie was not what was expected. It did not last as long as the minutes state. It was a loss of money, it may be worth $3 if even that amount."
1,"Clark Gable was sure lucky that this mess of a movie didn't end his career, being that it was his first venture after returning from active duty in WWII. The main trouble with the movie is his attitude; for some reason, Metro tried to revive the style of the younger carefree Gable in this film, the sort of fellow he was in ""It Happened One Night""--even Metro's memory was faulty, because that persona had already been replaced by the mature man of 1939' ""Gone with the Wind"". Here, he's just too old and had been through too much in real life (the war and the earlier death of his wife Carole Lomabard) to cavort around like he does in the movie, and with Greer Garson no less! I don't understand why the studio, having taken such pains to shape her image as a gentlewoman, had her buffooning around either. Check out the better post-war Gable of ""Homecoming"" and ""The Hucksters"", and leave ""Adventure"" on the shelf."
1,The author shares many of his political opinions that would be more approperiate on an Op Ed page rather than a text book.
1,"The ONLY reason I buy the GG DVDs (and I've bought every season so far) is to read the subtitles and enjoy the writing.What possessed them to exclude the English subtitles in this season? How much extra work could that have been?I will carefully review the specifications for the Season 7 DVDs before automatically buying it the day it is released.This time: no subtitles, no purchase."
1,"THE GOOD OLD SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY ACT AT THE END OF HIS SHOWS AND,THE INTERACTION WITH THE AUDIENCE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OFTHIS CONCERT ! I FEEL CHEATED."
1,"""Polite Lies"" wanders back and forth between kvetching and bellyaching. Complaints stain nearly every page. When Kyoko Mori was married, she objected to people asking about the color of her living room. She explains that she and her husband wanted to do as little decorating as possible. Then on the next page she is complaining about ""our mismatched furniture"" and ""how bad our furniture was"". A full review could provide endless examples of grouchiness expressed in well-turned phrases.Mori's insistence on painting herself as a malcontent overwhelms her otherwise valuable insights as a resident and traveler in two cultures. And when Mori offers comments on literature, the book seems to begin breathing fresh air.Mori writes that as a child she was a picky eater. The tragedy is that this habit expanded until it drove nearly every aspect of her life."
1,"Although I thought this book would be a comprehensive guide to Bret's life and career, I had hoped for more insight into his actual self. It doesn't really feel like Bret really had anything to do with this book. I love Bret, but not his book"
1,"This size of this guitar is good for our 2-year old, however the quality of the strings is horrible. You cannot get it tuned. The strings will not stay tight and they break very easily."
1,"I was extremely disappointed in this product because I couldn't get it to work at all, and there is no customer service contact number included to help me (or others like me who may be technically challenged). I would return it if I could."
1,"Between a rock and a hard place. The Sinkware 5061 seals the drain but rusts in about two months; the Danco 8821 doesn't seal, nor does it rust. I guess its better to have a device that does its job for a little while than one that consistently doesn't work well at all."
1,"This crap is made by a lazy company that leaves the dirt and sand in there and calls it minerals. If you like adding sand to your salt before sprinkling it on your favorite foods, this is the salt for you! If you like a salt that is loaded with minerals and flavor without the grit, get Spice labs Himalayan salt. That's what I did and I will never again spend my money on this gritty crap that they could have filtered but that would take too long and cost too much?Yet another company out of Utah that cuts corners and compromises our health...the other company is concentrace mineral drops ... that product was endorsed by a scientist who now removed his endorsement after seeing the filthy conditions that company now uses! Something wrong with Utah?!"
1,"Words escape me, to describe this as a book will be an insult to all pulp fiction"
1,"I am a longtime fan of Rod Stewart but the Songbook series is simply awful. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE these songs. It is just that they are available by Sinatra, Tony Bennett and other great singers. These albums would have been fine if done by Frank Sinatra Jr. who has a history with the great American songbook. It isn't just the latest ""thing"" or ""phase"" with Frank Jr. Rod Stewart should go back to being Rod Stewart. This cd is the worst in the series and should come with an extra raspy warning. Rod is simply wrong for ALL of these classic songs. Buy Sinatra and Bennett and hear perfection."
1,"This book is offensive with blatant, nonsupported blanket statements about the eternal dance between men and women. It is not respectful and it degrades women. Anyone who would take it seriously would destroy any relationship worth keeping. It's no wonder there is a 50% divorce rate -- probably occurs with people who read this stuff and believe this is how relationships and families operate."
1,"sick is a light word to describe this book. Some things I don't wanna know. The details are NOT necessary. Definitely not a book for a light stomach. It's not just lesbians...she seems to go both ways for awhile, then gets bored with men, explores with older women, obsesses over a woman her own age who ends up getting married, and in the end, it's an altogether depressing book. Whether this is the outcome of all homosexuals, or a dramatic complaint of one woman who kept on and never gave up, i don't know. However, pick Joan of Arc or Hellen Keller if you want a real story of perseverance."
1,"I bought this WI-FI card to use on my notebook computer and when I had troubles with the card. I called the company and when I was unable to submit a serial number (there was a blank space where the serial number was supposed to be) they told me then it was reconditioned.There was no disclaimer of this and to say the least I was PO'd. No wonder the card gave me dismal performance. It would require me to reboot every time I used the computer. This was a giant hassle and to say the least I jerked the card out of the notebook and inserted the old Linksys WI-FI card and set it up and never looked back.I ended up selling this reconditioned card for next to nothing loosing my investment. The card was not very expensive, but it was the idea of the fact, it was reconditioned without telling me it was so."
1,"My children and I just turned off Scholastic's video retelling of this book by Paul Zelinsky. (beware of spoilers ahead) Rapunzel was always a simple story to me. After watching the video, I looked up the tale of Rapunzel and discovered that this retelling by Zelinsky aligns with the story the Grimms told. If your child loved Tangled, I wouldn't read them this story--particularly if they are very young. In this retelling, the prince finds Rapunzel in a tower. One day when the witch comes to see her, she asks her loosen her dress because it was too tight. The witch responds that she's a wicked girl and casts her out into the wilderness--where she gives birth to twins! This retelling was not at all what I expected and wouldn't recommend. I love fairy tales, but we're going to pass on this one."
1,"Worst episode yet. Unless you're from New Orleans or know a LOT about it, you'll be lost and pretty bored for the whole episode. Skip ahead to the last 10 minutes and you'll get enough of the point to move on in the series."
1,I didnt order this item .. I came across it while doin a search .. based on previous experience with this supplier .. most probably u wont get it b4 it's expiry date .. cheers all .. and shame on u vitaminlife
1,"This book has such basic instructions, it would be more for a young student.For example, the porch swing directions;""Paint with white paint. When the paint is dry, sand the areas that would normally show some wear so that some of the brown stain is visible.""Really? That is the instruction?Additionally the book says that sources for paint and stencils are on page 111.I looked up the bench with cherries. No stencil source only paint colors.It is an older book, and I didnt purchase it new. So the designs are pretty dated.I'll continue on my search for the perfect guide for painting reclaimed furniture."
1,"""Excalibur"" proved that a movie can provide the setting for a spellbinding/magical story, action, intelligent character interactions, and nail-biting suspense. Unfortunately, ""Merlin"" fails miserably on all four counts. The culprits here are obvious plotting, mediocre acting, and pedestrian direction. The film has one legitimate surprise (no plot spoiler here), but it's way too easy to figure out the rest of the action before it happens. Martin Short fares the best of the cast, but he's stuck with the stereotypical role of the bumbling side-kick often found in most slapstick comedy films. Sam Neill shows no screen presence as the main character of Merlin who has to make things right. As for the direction, the film moved too slowly (especially at the beginning). Since I was always sure of MERLIN's outcome (unlike ""Excalibur""), the special effects were the film's only lure, and they were poorly done at best."
1,"I meant to put no stars on this book at all.The author can't even write more than two sentences before running into some concepts which he could not understand or could not explain. Same thing happened in all those ""admiring"" comments on this board. Either they are just hired pumpers, or they could only ramble on something they could not understand just like the author himself did in this book.DO NOT WAIST TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE."
1,Tried these extra stoppers in several different bottles. They will NOT work. Some won't completely allow air evacuation; others will not hold a vacuum for any length of time.... Received black stoppers although the original ones and the Amazon picture of the stoppers were gray. The black ones are not as soft & pliable as the originals. Seems I didn't receive what I ordered but some inferior knock-off.Buyers BEWARE!!!
1,"I bought this game (original-off-the-shelf) and went home to load it up. Installed great and when I went to play it... it would not work. I am serious! I spent hours going through the readme files with a fine tooth comb and they will tell you in the same file that THEY KNOW the game will not run with the majority of sound and video cards on the market. I patched the game and even installed it's included safe mode drivers (Yes it comes with a safe mode version- so what does that tell you!) and it still didn't work. I patched it- nothing! Wrote customer support and they said that they are aware; and I quote, ""Like yourself, we are very disappointed at the problem you are experiencing and are working hard to correct this"". So the bottom line is that they realeased this product loaded with bugs. It is a waste of money for people to buy it!"
1,"This film perpetuates the myth that a large percentage of the German population was clueless about the genocide taking place in their country. It diminishes the horrific brutality of concentration camp life. And it asks us to feel sorry for the one innocent German boy who was ""accidentally"" gassed, instead of the millions of others equally innocents who were systematically slaughtered. This film is insulting to the memories of all those persecuted under Hilter's reign."
1,I bought these for several desks in our office becuase they were cool. Blow air yeah right 1 inch from the fan. They are also loud and noisy.
1,"Just befor this movie came out I head that some of the real World War 2 vets. were very upset, because the flim makers had to stick a love story in the movie so Pearl Harbor would become the smash hit it did.If you loved the way overrated Titanic then you will love Peal Harbor, but if your looking for an war movie like the awsome Tora! Tora! Tora! then don't wast your mony on this DVD. No wonder the Japs. were mad at this movie."
1,"Worked OK for my small closet for about 6 1/2 months, then died. Not worth mailing to the manufacturer to fix."
1,"The religious lessons, theology, rites and ritual one is forced to endure while reading Faye Kellerman's books completely destroys any enjoyment of the mystery--threw it in the garbage after 100 pages. There's too many other interesting writers out there!!"
1,i picked up this game in a hurry knowing it was in fisherman. i knew they would give you info. about the fish. and best of all you can catch catfish!!!!!! but this game is repetative. you can use a fish finder that doesnt help. what came up as a huge fish on the fish finder was the smallest (...)crappie ive ever seen!!!!!!!!!! and the music!!!!!!! the music is what makes you angry in the morning. im like shut up. i know that you picked the first 3rd grade band you could find but at least dont tell us that. if you press mute you should have a good time w/ the game 4 4 hours tops. fish realistike and lures are realistike but i do wish the graphics were better.
1,"This is just a book for beginners and doesn't offer anything more than other French books that are written for the same purpose.If you have a choice of buying a cheaper book, go for that. The price does not necessarily mean that the book is better. However, it might mean that your instructor has got ""some incentives"" to ask you buy this specific book and not a less expensive one."
1,"I'm a huge Jane Green fan, but I must say I am disappointed with her latest effort. The writing style almost drove me insane - every time I read a paragraph beginning with ""For"", I wanted to scream! I barely made it through the book, and only forced myself to finish as I kept hoping that it would take a turn for the better. I loved all her earlier books, but would definitely recommend you pass on this one."
1,I was not impressed with the video quality that this cable gave. I have switched back to the original
1,"While the author may be a delightful man and a capable pilot, this book goes on the growing heap of failures in writing about flying, so far as i am concerned. In fact, it goes fairly far down even that heap, since i am one of those who can see most books to the end, but finally could not be bothered with this one.I have learnt that fliers who can write are very rare birds indeed.I am now learning to carefully ignore the reviewer star ratings here when making my own selections."
1,"How is it there is no subtitles for the bbc series. We the hearing impaired have a hard enough time hearing the actors as it is, add the british accent forget it we are totally lost. Having the subtitles will have people with this handicap purchase more bbc series. Thanks!"
1,"I order twice for the same product as a gift to my boyfriend and it bought us a lot of troubles. The first time we receive the product, the hand of the watch does not point exactly to the seconds, it is half way between each second. Besides, when we try to adjust the day,i.e Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the adjustment button will not turn and stuck on Wednesday. We returned the item and I order it again as a gift to send it to my boyfriend office. The package does not come with the gift message as it promised and this time the watch strip is defective. It produce a click, click sound when you try to put the watch over the wrist. I thought citizen is a named brand with good quality control and it turns out not."
1,"Worked great for ONE fly! Then it died. Tried new batteries, etc., everything. Called company for replacement since I was not happy with that level of quality. They promised a replacement. I called again 3 months later since no replacement had arrived. Another 3 month wait. Called company again. They had never heard of me or any replacement order. Not ordering THEIR products again!"
1,"The concept of a futon mattress atop slats is actually comfortable and I lay on it for a week happily until I made the mistake of putting too much focused pressure and snapped/broke two of the very fragile slats by climbing onto it with my knee first. Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch. These are not cushions with a black cover. This is a black cover filled with recycled fabric pulp. The rep was not interested in responding to my complaint. Don't buy this. Go to a futon store and buy something that resembles this and it will be much sturdier."
1,"I've had the same problems others are reporting. Style and usability seem great, but performance is quite bad. If I was in a quiet room things seemed to be ok, but if there is any background noise at all, people couldn't hear me. Any time I tried to use it in the car, people couldn't hear me or said it sounded terrible. Also, the range seemed to be very intermittent. If I was at home I could walk around without my phone and things would work great. In the car I would get low signal warnings and dropped connections all the time. Even when the phone was right next to the headset sometimes it wouldn't connect to my razr.I'm going to be returning it tomorrow."
1,I received the stapler in the mail and straight out of the box it didn't work. I've asked for a replacement. The hassle of returning it and the $7 they're trying to charge me to replace it makes me wish I hadn't purchased the stapler in the first place. I'd advise holding off on ordering this stapler for now! I'll let you know if the replacement works.
1,"We bought this unit from a small local store that is known for selling only quality merchandise. We took it out of the box, assembled it following the directions -- and the blade doesn't spin. It does't even engage. The motor runs, but absolutely nothing happens. I've learned my lesson! Read reviews before you buy anything, folks."
1,"FAIP PowerWasher Replacement Gun and Hose #80012I have a Powerwasher unit, so logically assumed this would work to replace a leaking hose. Wrong! I called Powerwasher. They said 80012 is not a part number they use. This apparently was made by somebody else and is thus misrepresented on the Amazon web site. The problem? The connection on the hose is a different diameter than on my Powerwasher unit."
1,"This uses Macromedia Director software to accomplish it's animation . .which is all fine and well until you realize they are stuffing you into a tiny box . . .with black backgrounds and white text. Do they know nothing about usability?I can't get very far into this, but throwing up some text on a small screen and reading it . .. is hardly dynamic.Might help some . .but with my screen resolution at 1024x768 I'd actually like to use more than 1/4 of my screen to learn.Lame, lame, lame."
1,"I read this paperback years ago and I enjoyed it. But there's nothing about it that warrants even the $28 price tag on the used copies, let alone $150+ on the new ones. Save your money; this is highway robbery."
1,"Totally useless, because upon ordering this product it was not posted that it could not be used with my cd player. You refused to exchange it for me and I doubt if I will use your website ever again."
1,"If you're the type of person who breaks into tears at a Dashboard Confessional concert you might dig this novel -- which is basically two-hundred tortuous pages of whining by some annoying, unfunny, overemotional, pretentious kid who thinks he's a lot smarter than he is. Everyone else steer clear of this cliche-ridden garbage."
1,"I was thinking this would be an electric grinder, though the price seemed a little low. It comes with flax seeds, and if it says a serving size is 2 tablespoons, I guess a test might show it takes 15 minutes of continuous hand twisting to grind that serving. Anyway, I returned it realizing it was way too slow for most uses."
1,"Like the other 1 star reviews, this wrench won't remove lug nuts hand torqued to 80-100 ft/lbs. It just hammers away and the battey dies before all 5 lug nuts were attempted. I'm about to send it back for repair to the authorized repair center. Don't waste your money. I hope I can report back that it was fixed... but I think the torque values are greatly over-rated. It does seem to drive nuts on just fine because it gets up to speed, but loosening? Forget it."
1,I'm very disappointed - I purchased it as a gift and watch turned out to be too huge. There should be clear information that watch is oversized.
1,"i am so depressed when i heard celine's album. nowadays she is really deproving day by day album by album...i am really sorry to say this...she won't go far if this go on...i have true faith in her, but i want something more solid and more down to earth..."
1,"I rarely take the time to review books or other items, but this book is just SO BAD I feel the need to let others know. In a word it is Bizarre. I am sorry I wasted the time on this one, I just kept thinking that the ending might redeem the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"I picked up this rack to help with my ball cap overflow. I have owned this type of rack before and they are so easy to put together I am sure they are user as Junior High wood shop projects.Having said that, this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. The wood feels like it is balsa and it is even missing one of the pegs and the mounting hook on the back. If I were to see this at a store I wouldn't give $.25 for it.I have never had the need to return anything to Amazon, but this is for sure going back. There is no way you couldn't find a better product somewhere else, like dumpster diving or at the swap meet.Expanding PEG Rack 10 Hooks Hardwood Multi-purpose Vertical or Horizontal Wall Mount"
1,"...It took me about 3 hours to understand that that was it, this WAS the game, and I was not going to get anything else. By that time my eyes were closing and I was falling asleep.This is what you do in the game - you listen to endless and pointless conversations directing you to do something, you go and do it, and when all of a sudden time comes to shoot, you shoot and run and shoot and run and turn and shoot and run and shoot and run and shoot and turn and run and shoot and run and run and run and shoot and shoot and shoot and turn and run.This game cannot be called strategic, because you are totally limited in choices, it cannot be called arcade because it is not only slow, there is no word in the language to say how slow it is. ..."
1,"Ok, so I ordered this book from the seller, and it said ""like new"" the book is nowhere near even ""good"" condition! It was all taped up and banged up. I'm very upset with this seller, I'm not getting any replies from them either, just BE CAREFUL, you'll probably NOT get what they describe you'll be getting."
1,"It's probably a little late to say this now, but I found this, which was my first LCD monitor, to be very disappointing. At first I loved it, it was a state-of-the-art 17"" LCD when I got it new, no dead pixels, just great. But after six months it started having random fritzing-out issues. Very likely a bad capacitor in the internal power supply. I was never satisfied with dealing with ViewSonic warranty service, and I have since moved on, but I just happened across the reviews here and wanted to give my two cents as another very disillusioned ViewSonic customer."
1,"There is a reason that Pete Best was replaced as drummer for the world's best known band. He simply was not very good. Uninspired vocal performances, poor choices of cover material, and uninteresting drumming make this CD unlistenable. Pete Best was replaced in 1962 for a reason. Lack of talent and charisma."
1,"Well, I guess since Air have evolved their sound, creating spectacular new and original albums, Zero 7 have fallen behind and don't know what to copy next. The Simple Things album was a complete Air rip-off wannabe album, and now Zero 7 are having trouble finding what to copy. Hey Zero 7- How about coming up with your own material!"
1,"The new iPod with video doesn't have a ""docket"" next to the earphone plug, so this product just wont fit..."
1,"We refer to Go Go as our drunkin pup all it does is bump into furniture and walls. If there is any background noise it gets confused and won't do anything you ask. We have tried making the house silent and still get the same results. Myself and a friend bought Go Go dogs last Christmas for our daughters and were both disappointed.We don't have much luck with this type of toy, we also purchased Poochie back when it was popular and it didn't do what was advertised either."
1,"I purchased this black sleeping bag from a local store and it was the last one in stock. I ordered the same colored sleeping bag from Target for a friend. Target shows this is a black exterior/grey interior bag like the one I own, but they shipped it in green b/c black is no longer available. I wish they would have that information on their website, b/c I would have not ordered green. Just be aware, several stores show it in black but will ship in green."
1,I found this book very slow reading. I could only read half of it. Perhaps if a movie is made then maybe I would see it.
1,"The book "" CS Tapestry"" often highlights terminology which isn't defined and then uses these terms for explanations in the text. It should have a glossary of terms and definitions and its editor should be hanged. The book should be written for a beginner's point of view. It's marketed as an introduction to the whole field -but gives little attention to the wider tapestry.I spent close to 100 dollars for this book and must invest extra money in supplemental books just to pass the course. He has written a book for beginner computer scientists that can only be understood by computer scientists. This takes no skill at all."
1,"Definitely do not bother. I was really excited to buy these glasses here instead of from the retailer because i would have been saving $30 or so, but do not bother with these, they're an imitation. If you're going to spend $70 on sunglasses, you might as well get the real ones for $114 from ray ban themselves, or buy the $5 imitation kind, because that is what these are worth. I'm really disappointed it took me too long to realize this fact, and so now I cant get refunded. Please do not waste your money."
1,"You've probably heard ad nauseum the importance of backing up your critical data before making any significant changes to your system in the event of a system crash. Nah! Couldn't happen to me!I agree with many of the other reviewers here. DO NOT INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE WITHOUT BACKING UP YOUR SYSTEM FIRST, AND BACK IT UP REGULARLY AFTER INSTALLATION AS THIS SOFTWARE WILL LIKELY KILL YOUR HARD DRIVE.Prior to my recent system crash, which from everything I've learned was caused by this software, I would have given it a 4 rating. Really user friendly GUI; easy to use; somewhat limited features.Now, having put in over two weeks of all nighters to recover data and reinstall my operating system and applications, I wouldn't touch this or any product made by Roxio until they produce a more stable product. ..."

1,"This is a terrible lube. The parabens in it cause bad burning sensation, and it's far too expensive for such a bad product. Try Sliquid's Sassy or Gel formula instead!"

1,"After having owned one of these for a few months, it died. It sat unused for 6 months and then when I connect it to the computer it isn't recognized. Formatting doesn't work, and Sony's special format tool doesn't work. My SanDisk on my keychain has been abused, dropped, and kicked around for over 4 years without issue and this one sat in storage for six months and it's dead."
1,"This model is absolutely junk. Nothing positive to say about this product at all. DONT BUY IT! Nothing fits together at all, pieces warped and molded poorly."
1,"At first the unit worked fine. Then it would occasionally freeze up (i.e. none of the controls would work, not even the power button), the only solution being to unplug the power cord and then replug. After a while, it was constantly freezing AND the scheduled recording was no longer reliable. At that point I gave up. Reading other people's reviews of Panasonic DVD recorders, it is clear that mine is not an isolated case. If you are interested in a DVD recorder, I would recommend checking out the Toshiba models. Buying a Panasonic is clearly risky."
1,"It was working fine but after a year or so of using it, the soybean mixture began to burst out from the vent. It's during one of the grinding phases and the bursts of grinding sending the mixture out through the vent like Mount St. Helen. After the eruption, the whole pot is wasted and leaving a messy kitchen for me to clean up..."
1,"I actually love this product. Because I can't have sugar, I have to seek out products like Barbara's sugar free/fruit only fig/blueberry bars.The only problem is that the expiration date on this product was Jan 9 2008, and this product was sent to me in March 2008. When I asked for another batch with a later expiration date, I was sent another 6 boxesin April with the same Jan 9 2008 date.Get with it Amazon, that's not okay..... The product gets noticably goeyand is not a firm cookie past the expiration date. I really wanted thisproduct, but had to ask for my money back due to this expiration date problem. Amazon gave me a $10 coupon for other Amazon products,but no cookies. Oh well, I guess I'll loose a few pounds...."
1,"Totally agree with comments aboveMy mouse comes with USB plug, everything was working fine till about one month ago it started messing with USB ports. Now I can not use any flash memory sticks without unplugging my mouse at first, if mouse is plugged in, computer crashes immediately. I tried to reinstall mouse software several times, but it made everything even worse and it seems I will have to reinstall Windows now.Don't use it even if someone gives it to you for free."
1,"This book is tries to be funny and helpful, but falls short on both fronts. It's useless as a guildine as often times there's no clear distinction between humor and honest advice. There are much much better books available, skip this one..."
1,"I purchased this mandoline a while back after doing some research, reading reviews etc.. First time I tried the straight blade I discovered the plastic holding the blade had chipped, undoubtedbly getting into the finished food product.. MIU must be a shadow company since there doesn't seem to be a way to directly contact them.. just the importing company which does not offer any help at all. The Stainless frame is impressive but the rest of the package is complete junk.. Don't know why folks liked it, maybe they haven't noticed the black flecks of plastic in their sliced potatoes or how fragile all the plastic parts are yet. THIS IS A DO NOT BUY if it ever does come back on sale at amazon or anywhere else. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT and send a message to MIU (if you can get a hold of them) to stand behind what they contract the Chinese factories to build for them.. Would have given it zero stars if I could."

1,"Unlike our other petsafe collar, this collar emits no sound. It looks like its supposed to. Nothing happens until the shock zaps you (or the dog). Worthless since the dog is afraid to go outside now and never gets warned about the parimeter."
1,"I used my HTP-6 Circuit Detective for the first time yesterday. The instructions seemed simple; however, I went to the web site and watched a video demonstrating how to use it. I thought things were progressing well until I checked the circuits by closing the breakers involved. The HTP-6 was wrong as often as it was right. So, what is the point? Perhaps I have a defective unit. Still, now that I have done the legwork and identified all of the breakers associated with all of the outlets and fixtures in my home, does anyone want to buy a once-used HTP-6 Circuit Detective which may or may not get you electrocuted?"
1,"I've been using this software for 1 year and its rate ofsuccessful burning has been only 80%. It causes deadlock all ofthe time. Yestoday after I uninstalled it, my win2000 nolonger can boot up.

1,"After using one time, the sweeper began making a clunking noise. After charging the battery the second time, it would only last a few minutes before needing recharged. The manual says to charge several times to realize the battery's full potential. I did that and each time I charged it the amount of time it lasted got less and less. The last time I used it the motor started burning up (at least that is what it smelled like). Now it doesn't work at all. It makes a horrible noise when I turn it on and the brush doesn't spin. I have only had it just over a month. In order for me to use the warranty to get it fixed, they want me to pay to ship it back to them and enclose a check so they can ship it back to me. Don't waste your time with this piece of crap. If there is a sweeper out there with a lithium battery- go with that."
2,"The pot is adorable, but burns easily. I should have bought a shorter wider butter warmer with a thicker base."
2,"In my opinion, Spiderman 2 and 3 were a huge dissapointment. Do not waste your time and money on this DVD, this movie was terrible. I saw this in theatres, hoping it to be really good, but no, it wasn't. It was all just [..]. Don't get it. Maybe worth a rent though."
2,"I bought my two Golden Retrievers each a Tug-n-Toss ball. They enjoy playing with them, but usually instead of retrieving them by the handle, they grip the ball in their jaws partially deflating it, which would not be a problem except that the material it is made from is soft and easily punctured by their teeth, enabling the ball to become stuck and they can't let go without help."
2,"Even with broadband (not like you can use it any other way...) this browser is way, way, way, WAY too slow. I'm returning mine. No need for a review. You can read other people's reviews if you're that curious.Trust me, it doesn't matter how well designed it is. (It kind of is.) It is unusable. Remember 56Kbps dialup modems via phone landlines? Well, the internet is different today; pages are much more complex.Anyway, remember 56Kbps and how slow that was? I swear this seems about a quarter of that speed. I don't know how fast it really is, but with today's more complex websites and the DS being not that fast with wireless data in the first place, 1/4 the speed of dialup may even be generous!"
2,"Lavinia Lake had every reason to dislike and distrust Tobias March. Claiming it was for her own good, Tobias destroyed the antique shop she owned in Italy with her niece. Forced to return to London, Lavinia turned to private inquiries. She literally runs into Tobias while investigating the man blackmailing her. They form an uneasy alliance when they determine they are working toward a mutual goal. An interesting mystery is the heart of plot of this story. The investigation is full of twists and turns and unusual details. The outcome is unsure until the very end, with the suspense building until the resolution. Unfortunately, the budding romance at the heart of any romance, is sorely missing from this story. Lavinia and Tobias grow to care about each other as the adventure progresses, but it is unclear if they love each other."
2,"To think we had to wait for that! The first three books were so amazing I didn't think anyone could have messed the story up, until Extinction. In my opinion the characters personalities were way off in this book. The story didn't seem to accomplish anything and was boring. The others seemed to have a direction or goal and by the end they achieved that goal. It lacked the use of interesting spells like the first three. Smedman seemed to use only the basic spells, nothing interesting or new. It did accomplish one thing, it left me wanting. Now I'm no expert or anything like that. These are just the opinions of someone who has read a few books."
2,"I have not yet finished the book but I wanted to see what others thought. I don't know why I keep reading these books. I find parts amusing (which I why I keep reading them) but I really wish the character of Becky wasn't so stupid and selfish. Why would someone like Luke stick around for this? What is endearing about Becky? She is just plain clueless about life and marriage. I think she is truly the most annoying character ever. I will finish the book but honestly, I can't stand Becky."
2,"I bought these chips thinking that I had found a bargain, but it turns out that they are lower quality than many other chips that I've played with. The finish is not as nice, and the cuts are a little rough. These are about 20$ cheaper than most 500pc sets and I think it'd be worth paying extra."
2,I AM A FAN OF THE DOOBIE BROS THE SONG SELECTION IS GOOD BUT THE AUDIO IS VERY POOR THERE IS ALOT OF BREAKING UP AND CHOPING AND BREAKING UP.
2,"When it comes to the English language, the most important aspect is the pronunciation. This is where I focus now. In general, the pronunciation of this unit is not too bad, but there are words that are mispronounced; for example, the word ""spank"" is pronounced as ""stank"" - this is unacceptable. Another area of concern is that the pronouncer in this unit uses ""monophthong"", so much so that in certain words diphthongs are minimized to an extent that it is inaudible. This report comes from the first critical examination. There are six more critical examinations. At this point, I would not suggest anyone to buy this product."
2,"Like many others, I have been wearing this shoe for years and this go round I am more than disappointed. The quality and feel of the shoe has definitely diminished."
2,"I held off writing a review on this product until after I had sufficient time to test and use the batteries. I bought them July of 05. It is 17 months later and here's how they stacked up. Five out of the 24 were DOA. Over a twelve month period, one would crop up dead on occasion, eventually winding up with another six batteries unusable. At the sixteen month mark they suddenly started dropping off one by one very quickly. Now it is December 31, 06 and I only have two left that still hold a charge.By contrast, I have a set of batteries I bought from Radio Shack. I considered them cheap and unreliable. I didn't expect them to last long. All of those batteries still hold a charge and work as good as new. In fact, out of all the rechargeable batteries I own, none have failed as rapidly as these have. I will not be buying them again in spite of the low price. Mom always said, you get what you pay for. She was right. These are cheap for a reason."
2,"I bought these to listen to my new Sansa Clip and, yes, they sounded pretty decent, quite bassy and laid back but after listening to them for only a few minutes, I noticed my ears started ringing. These things are too tight and press the music into your ear canals and may be some of the worst headphones you can use when it comes to your precious hearing. I'm taking mine back tomorrow."
2,"Ms. Hasan has tried to put a human face on Islam but,except for a few glowing reports, her own religious cohorts are unwilling to allow her to express any corralation between the ideals of a free and democratic society and Islam. One response to her post, someone from ""paradise"" aka India-insists that only Islam will bring the world to high place of ethics and morality. Will this be before or after we discuss the atrocities committed by the followers of Islam in India itself, the genocide in Armenia (1898-1915) or the palestistinian bus bombers of today.Ms.Hasan should be more honest and explain why Islam is unable to stop the abuse of honor killings,child labor and poverty in such places as the peoples paradise of India. Is it possible that Islam is a terribly flawed system of belief based upon a prophet who spoke of peace but never found it himself?"
2,"This game will be fine for youngsters. However, I, as an adult gamer felt the game ended way too soon, way too easily. The graphics are fabulous, but the game is a big disappointment. This is by far the easiest game I have played, and also the shortest."
2,OK. Sex and Money is certainly the basis for many an entertaining read but this guy really has nothing to offer. His nihilistism devalues any insights he might offer - unless you really care about how this guy made money despite the fact that he doesnt care for music - and he is sure you dont either. Hmmm.
2,"If you need a photo essay of beautiful models masturbating with dildoes, then this is your book. Some quite strange-looking dildoes too. This little tome could have been really so much better. In the introduction, the photographer notes that he only asked the models to be ""insolent and indecent"" in their poses. His instruction was indeed heeded. My own taste in photographic figure studies is ""artistic nudes"" who reflect some class, so this one goes back to Amazon. To each their own."
2,"Being a person who found Garland's well-reviewed THE BEACH to be nothing more than a re-hashing of LORD OF THE FLIES, I can't say that I was surprised with this novel. Garland's short-lived exploration of the concept of the tesseract reveals nothing more than the fact that he has fooled himself into thinking that he is the next Joyce, who explored similar ideas with his notions of parallax and metempsychosis. Some of the reviews exhibited on this page reveal that he has fooled a few others as well. Garland's lack of interest in his own characters is revealed dually in this novel, by the brief treatment that each character receives and by the narrative's oversight of the most sympathetic character, the deformed fisherman. The most disappointing part of this novel is Garland's loss of his unique descriptive style. There are no memorable phrases here to rival those such as a ""tie-dye sunset"" which appear in THE BEACH. Garland is a poor man's David Foster Wallace."
2,"I actually got up out of my bed to take this CD out. What she was saying was indistinguishable to me unless I turned it WAY up, and her voice had that lilting quality we use for baby talk. I found it annoying, not calming."
2,"I thought it would be better for the price, but honeslty if it was only $10, I would not buy it again.I have used this item faithfuly for several weeks, and have notice no noticable differece, and at times I feel my eyes burn and my vision is blurred.Very disapointed in this very expensive product!Would still like to know how safe this item is around the eyes?"
2,"Stace uses a number of interesting literary devices save a compelling plot. After Rose's departure from Love Hall, the story is muddled and plodding. I, like other reviewers here, found myself simply skimming in an effot to get to the predictable ending. Though the book started with great promise, it fell short. All in all, I wish I had saved my money."
2,"I haven't kept up with current music events like I used to in my college days, (10yrs ago). In fact I just found out Mazzy Star broke up a few months ago. I was happy to see hope was still recording so I was optimistic with this album. Sorry but it is just not the same. Hope still sounds good but the music is way to drab even for Hopes' style. This album isn't bad but it sent me running to my Mazzy CDs. Hope without Mazzy is like Harold Melvin without the Bluenotes, or like just one member of EnVogue. Again it's ok but the bar was set too high for this one to fly. Still love you thought Hope."
2,"I was expecting to get pictures in this book... there is none!I was really disapointed!Be careful, this book is only a listing of Chesley Bonestell work! Not any illustration of it!!!But if this is what you are looking for, it seems to be very well done and complete"
2,"Very disappointed with this oven. I thought that I could work in the time that it takes for it to warm up into my breakfast routine, but it took about 7 minutes for it to get to temperature. Putting bread in any earlier makes warm bread, not toast. Once warm it works very well and if I were using it solely as an oven, I wouldn't have any complaints, but when I was looking to make a purchase, I searched for ""toaster oven"" and this came up. I made the purchase, even thought I read the reviews warning about this product mainly because the handle and finish matches perfectly my Kenmore elite appliances.I am also disappointed because for $130 I would expect a little engineering to go into the slideout tray, either in the form of a hook that pulls the tray out when the door opens, or some kind of catch that keeps it from falling on the door when it is pulled out."
2,I usually read right through DeMille's books in one sitting but this one took me 2 weeks because the pace would pick up then it would SLOW>>>>>>>down and be soooo boring and then pick up a little again and slow down yet again. I had to force myself to finish the book and in the end was left with an overall disappointed feeling about Demille's latest effort. Hopefully the next one will be as good as he usually writes. If you are a first time Demille reader and found this book boring...go back and read some of his earlier works like The Charm School and Plum Island and my favorite Spencerville.
2,"It's so sad that been a fan and expect the blu-ray to have great quality picture, but when u get to watch and see how bad the picture is in the first movie, and worst: neither amazon or new line has done nothing to address this mistake. The other problem is that every single of the 3 movies needs 2 discs, seriously? 1 movie = 2 discs.If u are a big fan like i am DO NOT BUY THIS POOR PRODUCT, the lack of respect it's so big."
2,"Elementary Statistics was the book required for my class this semester and let me tell you - IT SUCKS!This book pulls numbers out of thin air constantly and instead of telling you how to apply (or come up with) a formula it will just say something like ""use a calculator to find ______""I honestly learned more from google than from this book, and can't figure out why someone would make this required reading material for any class."
2,"The title of the book suggests a far more incisive commentary than is presented. The reader is informed, but yet will be disappointed that many of the well-known atrocities to the Constitution have been ignored or reviewed in very moderate--politically correct--terms. Either a greater concentration on pre-20th Century history would have been preferable or the book should have dealt with events solely in the 20th Century, which some would consider to be modern times rather than history. Overall, not bad, but not particularly good for a reader reared and educated outside this country trying to obtain an unbiased understanding of what happened here in days gone by."
2,"I was very excited to watch this with my 12 year old son, who has never seen it, and even he asked ""where are the sound effects?"". This is a total rookie mistake. Upon reading the reviews I notice this problem has existed for well over a year and it still isn't fixed? What the heck?! I really don't get this at all."
2,"I like the pocket for extra batteries and the pocket for extra memory cards. I like the rubber tips on the zipper as well.What I don't like is that one of the zippers broke after (4) days of use. I have owned Case Logic products in the past and feel that I got a rare dud as I have always liked their products. I have emailed their customer service and will see what happens.I guess for $12, you just can't expect too much."
2,"Lewis is a great journalist, and a witty writer, but this is a lazy piece of work. He gets many facts wrong (see the recent Washington Post review for a complete list). Worse, he refuses to pass any judgement on the boorish and greedy Jim Clark. Also, the astounding lack of detail about Clark's personal life - his marriages, his children, etc. - is odd. Did he make a deal with Clark - no personal detail, in exchange for full access to business dealing? If so, Lewis never owns up to it."
2,"These things don't stay cold for more than a few minutes. Stick to ice cubes.Also, once you get them out it's hard to maneuver them back into place to get the lid back on."
2,"we didn't think jennifer aniston would chose a script this far in the gutter. some parts were cute, but another movie that takes sophomoric another flush lower. avoid."
2,"I wanted to like this single. I really did. I though the CD Single for ""Let Their Be Light"" has some really nice, dancable stuff on it that still had that Oldfield flare. I wish I could say the same of Far Above the Clouds Part One.As far as club/dance music goes, the first two tracks (the remixes) are pretty good. Not spectacular, but pretty good. The third is ""Far Above the Clouds"" as it appears on the Tubular Bells III album, so if you already own TBIII (if not, then get it!) there's nothing new in it.I think it's great that Warner is putting some marketing weight behind Oldfield. I hope they continue to do so. I just hope that their efforts will result in something that both old and new Oldfield fans can enjoy. This particular single isn't it."
2,"This blower is okay but it seems to take me longer than when I had my old brand. If you have long, thick hair, this dryer is adequate! The high speed setting throws out more heat, as expected but I still wanted it hotter. The low speed setting is great for styling if it was warmer. I have never dried my hair with this brand before. It is also lightweight but rather noisy."
2,"The socks aren't white, as shown in the picture, but have large colored bands all over them (pink and yellow). Obviously I'll live - they're just socks - but I'm disappointed and won't be using this seller ever again because I can't trust that I'll receive the item I pay for."
2,"The best part of this book is the beginning, where Budge traces the history of the Egyptian language and then its decipherment. All of these chapters are very interesting and informative. If you want to get a good picture of what the state of Egyptology was in the 1930's, then this is not a bad book for that, although the historical information is rather abbreviated compared to an actual history book.Which isn't surprising, given that this book's main purpose was allegedly to teach the ancient Egyptian language. Unfortunately, the field wasn't thoroughly developed when Budge wrote this book, so any new student would be better off reading a newer work. And, while I can't speak for others, I found the information poorly organized and impossible to learn from."
2,"The game itself isnt bad... the story line is alittle too easy.. you're pushed through this thing even if you try to fight it... my biggest problem with it... after an hour of play i get a pounding headache, my eyes water, and i feel sick to my stomach....The frame rate and jumping graphics are not something for the faint of heart..."
2,"This book has a lot of information, however it is outdated due to many recent occurrences of terroism that has happened since this book dated back in 1996. Bruce Hoffman is a excellent author, please get the updated version, 2006."
2,"I purchased this unit based on owning a prior Sennheiser headset. This unit is nothing like the old one. It is quite a bit flimsier, less comfortable, not loud enough, and the noise cancelling unit is large and unwieldy. In addition, the power button is easy to turn on by accident and thereby drain the battery. I will be returning it when I return from my trip."
2,"You really had me going there, Don. Not since Sandra Bullock in 'The Net' has someone been at the centre of such a gigantic conspiracy to silence the individual. The information 'they' were trying so hard to suppress is that the persons responsible were the DIA and SYRIA. Er....."
2,"Very disappointed in the movie, never saw a movie that could not keep my attention until this one. I do not recommend this movie to anyone-sorry."
2,There are some really bad songs on here. Some really cheezy boring songs. Some OK songs. Some filler songs. A really poor effort. Eric Johnson set the bar too high with his previous albums which were fantastic. This just misses the mark in so many ways. Vocoder. 80's electronic drums. Vocal auto-tune?? Really??? Pass on this one and get his previous albums first.
2,"I bought this game anticipating a very fun and enjoyable experience. How wrong did I turn out to be! This game has great graphics and a wonderful premise but the emphasis is on resource management and that detracts from the game. You have to have resources (food, gold, etc...) to create units but also to MAINTAIN them. So your resources are constantly being drained. The more units you have the faster the resources are drained. The game claims to let you have up to 8,000 units on screen (divided by the # of players) but I can't imagine how bad it would be if you had 500 or so units. The game has wonderful possibilities but this emphasis on resources takes away from what could be an enjoyable game. This game is only for those who have plenty of time (4 or so hours) to spend on a single game. It is too tedious for me to be considered fun. For this reason, I can't recommend this game."
2,"For all you out there, this is really NOT Science Fiction, the great literature we sci fi fans love to read (and sometimes write). What this was was a bad Star Trek episode, and I mean from the 60s. Sure there were some decent special effects, but what about story, plot, character, etc. On second thought, it was a bad Battlestar Gallatica episode. Sorry trekkies."
2,"I am happy with the umbrella. Looks good with my patio furniture and met my expectations based on other positive reviews. Apparent problem with shipping caused initial shipment to not arrive. I sent email to customer service when the shipment had not arrived 4 days past estimated delivery date and ""Tracking"" indicated it had not even been received by carrier. The response I got was worse than useless. Contained boilerplate message stating that everything was OK and I would receive product by estimated date (which was already 4 days past). Appeared the customer service rep did not even read my email and just hit button to respond. Used link on email response the have someone call me. Person on phone was very helpful and agreed that there was a problem with initial shipment and arranged for another umbrella to be shipped. I received the second shipment in one day."
2,"Pros:-Cheap compared to other brands with similar functions.-Nice, when it works.Cons:-I dont like the o-rings the use to mount everything. Seem stable enough.. but I prefer zip-ties.-Finicky. My first ride I got ""too many signals"" error message for the first 2 miles, even though I was by myself, and not using the HR monitor. My second ride, the speed sensor worked 95% of the time, but the HR monitor kept reading 0, even though I had wetted it as described.-Some people prefer the 4-button interface, but I don't. Hard to remember what each button does in each mode. Not a big deal though.I gave this one a try... but in the end I returned it and when with the Cateye Strada Wireless, which took 2 minutes to install, and works perfectly."
2,"I didn't like it becuz it was boring and it wasnt interesting to me. I would recommend it to a person that likes boring books. I wouldnt recommend it becuz if u wanna read a good book its not ""Out of the Dust"" cuz like I said before its so freakin BORING... LOL but anywayz that is wht I think bout ""Out of the dust"" Well if u read it u well knw wht im talkin bout...LataP.B"
2,"The book is far better than this Eastwood CD. The book is more complete, and more comprehensive in the story of this vicious bloody battle and the men who fought and died there. The movie has far too many flashbacks(and sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks) and seems to focus more on the lives of the 3 surviving flag raisers than the battle itself and all the brave US Marines and sailors who died there. The movie is often hard to follow and I can only assume the viewer is supposed to know what the actor is thinking at times without the benefit of dialogue, but I couldn't and I read the book.I would not buy this CD knowing what I know now, but I highly recommend the book by James Bradley. His is the real story."
2,The magnets aren't very sturdy. Some of the states don't even fit together correctly and the magnets slip out of the book---it would be nice if it had a latch or bag or something to keep them in. I would only buy this if it was less than 5 dollars.
2,"This is a children's book about Larry Ellison. The hard cover is thicker than the 80 pages contained within. If you want a few hour read to get some info about an amazing and interesting man, you've found it. If you want any depth at all, go elsewhere."
2,"Overall, I found the book (2nd printing) to be an ok read in that it gave several good tips of what to expect on the exam.On the negative side, there were way to many attempts to sell the authors other SBS 2003 books. Frequently, a topic would be covered lightly and then a sales pitch for ""more information in our blah blah blah book"". If this book is supposed to be the 70-282 prep guide, why should the reader be forced to buy another book just to have the material covered?"
2,"The concept is great and looked like a lot of fun, but my nephew lost interest faster than I could put it together for him. IT was not easy to put it together and packing it all away wasn't so great either. When the truck is put together and locked together, it inevetibly popped apart spilling out the contents. When it was opened up the sides fell off or the scenery fell apart. The cars are cool and the talking part as good, but over all, it was a disppointment"
2,"I was seeking an answer to the question, ""Who is spying on me and how?"" The modern workplace at large corporations, like mine, has changed. Technology pervades almost every communication and personal encounter. Am I being tape-recorded by my peers? How is my internet usage tracked and is it used to create a profile of my behavior? How can I use these tools to keep current? Are we crossing the line into paranoia? These questions are not answered, but are captivating to me. Anecdotes seem to ingratiate those involved, rather than communicate effective counter-tactics."
2,"Honestly speaking, I was disappointed when I read this book. Especially since I really enjoyed SEP's other books like First Lady and Kiss An Angel. Her writing style is definately different with Hot Shot. It is more factual and there wasn't enough humour in it to hold my attention for long. It took me three days to finish the book when I usually can finish SEP's books in one day. That's how boring it was!"
2,"Bag was inexpensive and gets the job done in terms of cushion and wheels. The knock is that it is bulky for my golf bag and I'm using a cart bag, not a walking bag. Would be doubly so for a walking bag. Almost as if it was not developed for a golf bag. This difffers from my previous soft bags which have hugged my clubs/bag well making it easy to carry w/ the shoulder strap. I will have to use the wheels at all times on this one. Great for a golf trip with the boys b/c you could probably fit all of your clothes in here as well."
2,"My 12 month old cries when I put it on because it bores him. It doesn't hold his attention. It could be because he is used to DVDs like Brainy Baby, which he LOVES! I was looking for something new for a long car trip. This didn't last long."
2,"I have the laserdisc of this movie. The storyline has quite a few problems, the acting also lacks direction. Years ago, before the premier of this movie, my pal, Andre, asked if I thought it was going to be any good. I replied ""Who cares, its a vehicle for another Prince album."" Forget the storyline on this one folks, enjoy the music! Besides New Power Generation and Thieves in the Temple there's great music by The Time, Tevin Campbell, Mavis Staples and George ""funkadelic"" Clinton."
2,"I played this one online for a bit.Wasn't overly impressed with it though, it was something new so I went for it andwhile not terrible then, it is now.Another early upstart in the rpg's being pushed online though.The map building tool was fun, we exploited it to have massive in rushing monsterswith BA guards posted nearby that could slay them so we could easily level up.Definitely had entertainment value.If you played it now though you may be a little put out."
2,"WARNING!!!!! Bit-rate is too LOW @ a horrible 167-170kbps!!! :^( I fixing to call customer service for a full refund since it says in the item drescription this is a ""remastered"" recording, and average MP3 bit rates on Amazon are supposed to be ""256""!..."
2,"They should have stopped with the first movie ""The Dog who saved Christmas"". I was dissapointed a lthough it was cute."
2,"Contrary to popular thought the Black Keys do in fact not rock. In fact they are quite boring. Akron, Ohio was once the home of Devo and the Rubber City Rebels. Good stuff that had gusto and energy. Albeit a long time ago. This is flat, ""young white guy trying to sound like an old weathered black guy"" blues. I'm insulted I ever listened to the reviews.To rock you have to put forth some passion and some kind of drive. This has none of that. And hooks? None to be found. The lyrics are quite simple. Woe is me...my girl is gone. But I got no sympathy here."
2,"This one does look cute,but is not comfortable to walk at all.I went for a half smaller size than usual but still have problems when walk a lot.I suggest trying on before purchasing online for this kind of wedges with ties."
2,"I got this receiver as a Christmas gift Dec. 07. It is in the service shop after a week of service due to overwhelming smell coming from receiver when turned on. I described the smell to JVC customer service as ""acrid, smokey, toxic, headache causing smell"". The unit is operational, but just not possible to be in the same room with it when its on."
2,"Titanic was just a maudlin, over-acted, cliche. The love story in this movie was so predictable. The moments of highest emotion between Jack and Rose were a little nauseating. The acting was stilted. In the end I was cheering for the iceberg.The special effect were pretty cool, however. That couldn't make up for a lame story."
2,"I know that for the price paid for the item, that I shouldn't expect miracles, but seriously... 2 stuck pixels and the uneven backlighting on this monitor are completely crappy. It doesn't even produce that great an image over DVI. I have yet to get fed up and switch it to see if it works any better on an analog connection, so if I ever do it, I'll update my review.I have a viewsonic Q20wb which I use at work and it's flawless...beautiful backlighting for great black-level performance, no stuck pixels, and great color calibration.The Acer just doesn't live up to the hype... Spend 20-30 bucks more for something better."
2,I bought it worked great but it stoped working so I wanted to sent it back to get fixed and the shipping was costly and they gave me a new unit but it stoped working.
2,"Thin and perfunctory renderings of common information: an absolutely dull stew with no visceral effect whatsoever. The historical content is vague & undocumented, and only marginally above that of pulp magazines. There are so many better books than this: don't bother!"
2,Had to return this because it was way too small. Ordered similar item without the mock neck and it was true to size.
2,"If you are interested in this book take the time to read Walt Brown's November 1, 2003 recant of his recommendation found on the jacket of this book. It has some very interesting information. Since it's not fair to quote the entire statement a little bit of effort is required. This is easily found on the internet and is titled ""clarification."" Hint; search on Barr clarification ""Walt Brown""From Brown""s clarification, ""I cannot, in good conscience, castigate the Warren Commission's work, on one hand, and widely endorse a mistake-laden, ""factionalized"" account on the other. It would be hypocrisy, and despite my LBJ beliefs, I cannot do it.""By the way, I do agree with Brown's assessment that LBJ was involved in the assassination."
2,"I bought this book with a lot of high hopes. What I got was a lot of second rate cakes that still tasted like cardboard boxes. The chocolate or more heavily flavored cakes turned out better than the white or yellow cakes, but considering all the preparations needed for most of these, it doesn't take any longer to bake from scratch.I grew up with a pastry chef for a grandmother. I remember what real homebaked goodies tasted like. Give yourself a break and try to bake from scratch when you can. You'll be amazed at the difference in flavor and texture. There are some nice simple baking books out there that can give you all the recipes you might ever need.Overall, this book can work for people interested in having a wide variety of cakes but not especially interested in baking. I was disappointed. It's on my ""giveaway"" shelf at the moment."
2,"I have read many books by Sharon Sala/Dinah McCall and this one was a major disappointment. The writing was terrible. The clues as to the killer were so obvious, you knew who he was in the first couple of chapters. In addition, the phrase :Oh, My God"" and it's variations were used to express every emotion from suprise to disgust to dispair - over and over again. I had to force myself to finish reading it just to see if maybe I had been wrong about how the murderer was. Unfortunately, I wasn't. Sala has written so many good books but if I had read this one first, I would never have bought another one. I'm hoping she didn't really write it - that she used a ghost writer for this one."
2,I bought this for a new puppy and it just slides around on our hardwood floors. Needs rubber feet or something to keep it in one place. I found the panels impossible to adjust once they were interlocked. It is difficult to open and close. I just ended up lifting the puppy out of it instead of trying to open the panels. One of the panels was so hard to open it broke within three weeks of purchasing it.
2,"This book has lots of financial worksheets and checklists, but they're not written in a helpful manner or format. Plus, you end up entering much of the same info into many checklists over and over again. Worse, the text is really painful to read. It's not broken down into bite-size pieces or written in plain-English. And I have to agree with Mr. Bingham that it is hard to use the CD-ROM because you have to click into each folder to see what's there and then click into BOTH the PDF forms and text forms folders, because sometimes the forms in the two folders are just duplicates of each other while other times a form only exists in one folder or the other. In short, the book is heavy on forms and worksheets whose usefulness is questionable, and light on text."
2,"Reel mowers have been around for quite a while and it baffles me to no end why there is still not a decent grass catcher for this ""classic"" lawn mower. Just a small wind from behind or a small amount of grass collected along the forward portion of the catcher ensures that you have to continually stop and manually redirect the grass to the rear of the bin or plan on raking.Installing the catcher to the bar is a chore each and every time unless you store the catcher on the rear of the mower. That increases the amount of storage space you will need by not a small amount.I've done my bit for the environment this year, but next year may bring the ear plugs and a gas engine back into my yard. Reel lawn mowers are real pains."
2,"I love animated movies and was particularly interested in this one due to the high profile actors, but is was extremely disappointing to the point of giving me a headache.The story is a good one, but it never really gels enough for anyone to care. Finally, the viewer never buys into pulling for any of the characters. This is a major flaw. Who cares which characters make a surprise comeback as you didn't care when they left in the beginning. Plus, was Megamind that terrible to begin with? Maybe, but you had to search for clues to find out if you cared or not. Again, great story line but poorly developed."
2,The SD card feels cheap. The first time I inserted the card in my digital camera it was not recognized.Also my computer does not read the card and freezes when i insert the card in the SD-slot of my pc.I only managed to retrieve the photos of the sd card by connecting the camera to my pc via usb.
2,"I was looking for tinwork ideas and patterns I could trace, cut out and punch. This book goes into the geometry of creating elbows, cones, etc. It is more of a math book. It's not what I was looking for."
2,"I though I'd saved a few dollars in this purchase, but it was'nt worth it. The product really has two problems: it does not really cancel outside noise unless your volume is up to eardrum shattering levels and the headset is so uncomfortable that with extensive use a hair loss or scalp injury is most likely. Buy Boss (I wonder if they'll accept a trade in) or make sure you try the product at a dealer's store. So much for internet purchasing."
2,"If you just want to switch from VB to C# and are looking for a good how to reference this is not the book for you especially as it pertains to Microsoft Word. There is a solid description and how to for the range object, but that's about it. Word's Bulleted/Numbered List object, arguably the most convoluted of them all, doesn't even get mentioned and tables are glossed over in barely 2 pages."
2,"I think i would be far more impressed with this book if Mr. Hyams had internalized anything he wrote about. I have nothing against the author personally, but i also see no obligation to diefy someone who does not hold true to his writings"
2,"The dish is a good idea, but the bottle did not empty water easily into the the dish. I ended up pouring my own water into dish."
2,"I bought this item for my cat. The cat just LOVES laser pointers! I bought this item due to the fact that it uses AAA batteries. Simple to find and replace, right? WRONG!!! I have tried to replace the flimsy and weak batteries that came with the pointer (the brand is Powtek, ever hear of them?) to no avail. It seems that well known brands such as energizer, duracell, eveready, etc. will not work. They are just slightly too large for this item. I thought all AAA batteries were the same size, but evidently this is not the case. The Powtek brand AAA batteries are just slightly skinnier than the well known, and therefore easy to find brands. So go ahead and get this product if you plan on throwing it in the trash once the batteries need replacing"
2,"Compared to past Case Logic purchases and to recent purchases of similar no-name products, this Case Logic CD wallet feels very cheap. They nylon is very thin and looks like it will not stand up to much wear and tear. The slots are about half a millimeter too narrow: CDs fit very snugly, while CD liner notes are a struggle to get in and out. Overall, it will suffice, but it's a disappointment. Based on the quality of this product, I will avoid this brand in the future."
2,"What can I say, must be my dog is too strong on the toy. She is a Lab. and has a tendency to destroy stuffs."
2,"Frank M. D'Alessandro's book is not for the first-time Sacco and Vanzetti reader. ""The Verdict of History on Sacco and Vanzetti"" is the fourth book I've read on the subject, and I still found it difficult to follow. The writing and organization are both poor. There are few references given in the test, and there is no bibliography. Dr. D'Alessandro is a very strong supporter of the innocence of the two Italian anarchists and makes no attempt at a balanced presentation. He does, however, make some strong points which had not occurred to me before. I would like to see the same material presented in a more formal, rigorous way with refutations on the points made by recent ""guilty"" authors like Francis Russell."
2,"We just got this kitchen set this weekend, and I am disappointed enough to try to warn others of it. The assembly was no problem...what is a huge problem is the fact that the oven is 2 inches tall inside. I kept thinking maybe we built it wrong, but have decided that is how big it is. Needless to say, you can't put anything in it! I don't know what the point of having an ""interactive"" oven is, if none of the food can even fit in it! Another problem...the interactive part of this kitchen is a joke! There are 17 of the foods that work (as if a child can choose which will make a noise out of the other 50 that will not). The definition of ""interactive"" on this toy...when you put a specific piece of food on top of the stove top (none will fit inside the stove) a little voice will say, ""Yum! Eggs!"" That's it. Very disapppointing!"
2,I thought this bacteria was working well until my pond turned green/brown. It is completely opaque and I can not clear it using this product. I may try a different type of bacteria to see if it improves.
2,"I just took the hard disks from within the enclosure and put them into a Drobo and 3 out of the 4 drives are working just fine. It looks as if the circuit boards that held them together fried but the actual drives (but for one) are fine. As to Drobo, it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! Specially the last one with Firewire 800 to the Mac and really silent."
2,"In the product description it says ""These darts are slightly smaller than regulation size"". This is a considerable understatement as the darts are quite small, not just smaller. My regular darts are six inches long and these darts are four and a quarter inches long. They were too small to use and I tossed them out."
2,"Cape Breton Road is a book that could have been a masterpiece of literature. Instead, it turned into a mind-numbing repetitive description of woods and water. Count, if you can, how many times he uses the same descriptive words for trees and cold. The book comes more alive in the description of Innis' painful feelings of love for the unattainable Claire. As for the ending, it reminds me of the gimmick sometimes used by film makers. You supply the ending. Worse, the author didn't know how to end his book."
2,"Classic Albums should have treated 2112 and Moving Pictures as seperate features. No mention of ""The Camera Eye"", ""Witch Hunt"", or ""Vital Signs""!!!!!! The interviews are more of the same. I wish they went more in depth into the making of the albums. Maybe show more demonstrations solo on their instruments. Talked about gear used. What synths, amps, fx, guitars etc.... Meaning of the lyrics to those songs.Some of the bonus stuff is cool. Neil has some cool drumming footage. 2 stars for that."
2,"I was happy to find a BPA-free sippy cup with a straw (this was the only I could find) because our speech therapist suggested a straw sippy. They worked great for about a month, but they're not very toddler proof. My son dropped them a couple of times and the ring of plastic around the bottom started to crack. The plastic comes off in sharp small pieces that would NOT be good for him to eat (fortunately he's not sticking everything in his mouth anymore.) It also leaves pretty sharp pieces sticking out. Unfortunately, you can't just pull the plastic piece off because it's glued on."
2,"It was great for target practice with a 22 cal rifle, crossbow and bb gun. Not recommened for AK styles."
2,MICK HARTE WAS HERE is an emotional book. The book talks about death.This book has the characters crying. That book has the mother taking sleeping pills.That is why MICK HARTE WAS HERE was so emotional.
2,"Not much different than the others in the series. Fern needs to hire another publisher as there were 5 spelling errors in this book (pages 79,85,90,112,and 151). Discouraging to find a published work with so many errors."
2,"Very disappointing version of P&P. I felt that the actors were rushed in trying to portray an epic movie and there wasn't the fit seen with the previous actors. The only version that I have seen so far that was by far the most timely and consistent to the book was the BBC A&E 1995 version with Colin Firth and Elizabeth Ehle. Although one person wrote that the ages of the actors (Firth/Ehle) didn't seem to coincide with the characters due to their maturity, one must remember the time period in which Jane wrote. People were far more mature for their ages then they are today and I felt the two fit the maturity given of the times. Also the other characters just didn't fit right either. Given that movies tend to go long nowadays, they could have spent more time/length in this one."
2,"Yes, the cards are quite appealing to the eye. This is the reason I purchased them. And the cloth is a nice touch. But the book is shoddy...the cover fell off the day I purchased it. I was so disappointed! On top of that, you can tell when a card is inversed - and there's no mention made as to the symbolism of a card should it happen to fall into that ""upside-down"" position. Overall,I wouldn't spend my money on this deck if I were you."
2,"The WWS 800 CCD scanner is much cheaper than the WWS 850 laser scanner - but I found that it was inferior in all ways. Unless there was perfect lighting and a perfect barcode, the 800 couldn't decode the scan. The 850 is much more expensive but can read barcodes in any light and with many flaws."
2,I purchased the 10 cup model and about a month later it quit pumping after making 2 cups. I had to turn it off and back on every 2 cups it made. I took it back to the place of purchase and swapped it for another one. It has been almost the exact same amount of time and it quit pumping again. I like the concept and the maker design but they really need to improve the pumping system.
2,I bought this collar for a miniature poodle who only barks at people visiting my home and he barks at them the entire time they are there. When Sam came to live with me almost 3 years ago he was 6 months old; he still barks at my son when he comes to visit which is frequently. The collar works but I must have the leash attached to it so that I can control his barking; therefore I must have notice when someone is coming so that I can put the collar and leash on him; of course that doesn't always happen. There is no latch mechanism on the collar; you have to unclasp a link to take it on and off; this is not easy; it may loosen over time but it has not yet. I bought 2; one for my toy poodle who barks at everything except visitors; needless to say I returned that one. Next I will try a shock collar.
2,"I've heard everything the puppets released except for three records (forbidden places, monsters, and too high to die), and so far I rank this as their worst effort.It's a much more radio-friendly effort than their earlier works. That in and of itself is not always a bad thing, but this cd really bores me.I guess Automatic Mojo is decent, but I MUCH prefer the version that appears on LIve in Montana. As far as I'm concerned the only essential song on here is Sexy Music.The rest of the album is OK at best. Bad Love and Dry Rain are my least favorite puppets songs ever. How anemic can a chorus get?Instead of Huevos, you should get Meat Puppets II or Out My Way. Live in Montana is also very good, and I also really liked their debut album (although not recommended for beginners, as its incoherent mumble/scream vocals might turn some people off)."
2,"These write just like any other regular BIC pen, just okay. The colors are vibrant and pretty, but are not at all glittery in my opinion."
2,"From page one of Choke, you immediately know that Chuck Palahniuk is a great writer. Unfortunately, while the prose pops and the story moves quickly, this book ultimately goes nowhere. The story is thin to say the least. Basically, the plot involves a sex addict's ill-planned quest to be a good son. However, most of the book really just amounts to Palahniuk describing bizarre sex practices. Although there are many different ways to tell a story, this ultimately goes nowhere and has little relevance to the plot. The ending, and the events leading up to it are not worth the time."
2,"By now, with his third film, Tran Anh Hung has no new elements to sustain his debut, Scent of Green Papaya. Hung tries so hard to avoid the war politics of Vietnam and gets bogged down on melodramatic mess. It is sad that Hung, respected by western critics, is in deep denial of Vietnam's colonial history. In Cyclo, he deals a little bit with the sociological aspects of Vietnam; unfortunately, he does not probe deep enough to be compelling.'Being compelling' perhaps is Hung's problem. The characters, particularly the three sisters, in this movie are flat, one-dimensional, and utterly unconvincing. Furthermore, they are exoticized, especially Hung's own star and real-life wife, who played the youngest sister. The plot is so thin and choppy. The pacing of this film is so erratically episodic and as slow as molasses.Hung focuses on so much so on the visual aesthetic that he completely abandons the storytelling aspect of the movie."
2,I had to watch the second one to fully understand the whole concept of this creature. My advice - just watch Jeepers Creepers 2. It is much better!
2,"'Smart Spin Storage System' is a great idea turned into a not-so-great product. I bought mine from an As seen on TV store locally. The containers are fine but lids are NOT 'easily pillable' as they show on the infomercial. The containers are smaller than they seem but that's not really the issue. I will not recommend for anyone to mail order this item, because the returns are hassle. Try buying from a local store, check the store's return policy so you can return it if you don't like it."
2,"I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it, so I thought I might like the Alps chair too. I was wrong. It's very light weight, but it's a lot longer than my other chairs, which made it more difficult to carry and transport. The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings, one of which broke the first time I used the chair. The next day, three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points, throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless. Save your money on this one."
2,"Lil Bow Wow, excuse me, Bow Wow has shown a little growth on his latest cd, but it's still all but deep or influential in any way. His topics might a little more mature, but trust- it's still for the kids. It's basically for the same fans he has always had, since they've grown up with him (just a little bit tho). Other than that, the hit ""Let Me Hold You"" featuring Omarion and the next one called ""Like You"" featuring Ciara are cool- the rest are album fillers."
2,"I purchased the audio book, read by Dick Hill. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star was because I listened to the whole thing. I kept holding on to hopes it would improve. It did not. My wife and I listened to this while on a long road trip. Had there not been a dearth of radio stations available, I would not have suffered through this drivel. I have read other books by Stephen Cannel, and compared to his television work, found them disappointing as a whole. The Viking Funeral is among the worst. I think this was due, in some part, to the reader, Dick Hill, but the plot and writing style were barely tolerable. If you enjoy mysteries, pass this by. Go re-read something by Robert B. Parker, etc."
2,"I had never seen this film and was interested in it because of the director (John Sturges), my favorite actor (James Garner) and the topic (post OK Corral life of Wyatt Earp). I was disappointed.First the story plodded along and seemed disconnected. It lacked a flow and did not build up to the final showdown. In Gunfight at the OK Corral, the story built to the big battle with minor incidents that feed the build up. Here everything seemed like separate events.James Garner (who I really like) did portray a much different Wyatt Earp but I think he was much too stoic. I think he over did the emotionless aspect of the character.Jason Robards was not very good a Doc Holiday. I think he did not bring out any real character attributes for us to understand Holiday's motivation.The story said it followed the real life events, but it deviated in signficant ways. Earp never shot Ike in Mexico.Lastly, the movie was just plain dull."
2,"The writing style of the book was fast with the main character, Nick Escalante, an interesting complex character that wasn't all that likable. However, the timeframe of everything happening over a few days forced the appearances of other characters to be short and sweet, and the characters were far from ""fleshed out"". I found there were a few too many ""coincidences"" that were hard to accept. ""Red Herrings"" weren't really explained well and the ending was more of a comic book ending than I expected. Also, if you don't want to know what's coming then don't read the dust jacket summary!"
2,"I got very good impression on fuji products and when my fuji 3800 died I picked this fuji s3100. Unfortunately its focus was horrible and I had to zoom in and out to get a clear picture. It has no sound, which is another bad thing compared with 3800."
2,"A disappointing product overall.The look/appearance of these grinders is nice, smooth contemporary design. I also enjoyed how they have a light that illuminates your food as you grind.The quality of the grind left much to be desired. These mills have two settings, coarse and more coarse. As you see in the title, I think it's inappropriate to characterize these tools as ""grinders""; ""splitters"" would be more accurate. Although some small specs of pepper do come out, most of the chunks were large enough to crunch when you ate them. This occurred on both ""fine"" and ""coarse"" settings.If you don't mind coarse, rocky pepper, this is the perfect set for your home. If you prefer nice, evenly ground pepper, you should look elsewhere."
2,"Unlike some Western war movies that a) pack a punch in 1hr 45min, b) have a script that promote and demand a compassionate response from the watcher, I was sadly bored to death by this movie.It may be due to the translation, it may be due to the social and cultural differences between Korea and myself; though I have many excellent Korean movies. I just didn't feel moved by this movie in the scenes that were obviously contrived to do so. The acting, script and direction just flopped. Yes there are scenes with arms coming off and blood spurting, but that's not what makes a god war movie; that only adds a sense of realism for all you armchair soldiers who have never felt the pain of combat (and that includes me).Sorry, I just don't agree with all the hype this movie gets, it really isn't worth 5 stars."
2,"This book may be useful for someone writing their first high school or undergraduate paper, but is not going to be useful to someone writing a graduate level thesis.This book covers basic research methods (like how to find a book in a card catalog), directions on note taking, and a good portion of the book is devoted to citing resources and quotations in MLA and Chicago documentation styles. If you have had an academic background that required a lot of writing none of this information is going to be new to you. Additionally, these documentation styles can be freely researched on the internet for a quick refresher.This book is also quite dated, pointing out that the final manuscript should be typed and not handwritten, and advises ""The typewriter should be in good working order. The ribbon should retain a sufficient amount of ink for a uniformly clear imprint..."" Surprising, considering this book's most recent edition was published in 2003.Save your money."
2,These DVDS were in great working order and are just like off TV. They are old and picture quality is older. For some that might be an issue but I wanted just what I had as a kid! The Amizon packaing was fine but the cases the DVDS came in where damaged and broken which leaves me to believe they were broken before shipping. SAD for all that money.
2,"This is a very detailed analysis of various artists and films etc. Bronfen has done an exhaustive anlysis of Hitchcock's Marnie which seems inaccurate. It is very doubtful that Marnie fulfills the diagnosis of being an hysteric. Marnie would appear to have narcissistic wounds;a narcissitic personality disorder;PTSD, and a quite sever disorder of the Self. . And anyway one wonders how usefu this is as a way of viewing the film or book. although the book is very intersting, its basic tennent is unconvincing."
2,"Got a replacement, and new unit works GREAT! - Amazon won't let me change Stars, but I'd change to 4.5 if I could.!I purchased this after reading the reviews. I had no desire to use this for a party or large gathering, just one serving at a time ( 4-8 dogs). I tried it the day after it arrived and once since. The heating coils turn warm, but they don't warm up enough to prevent touching them after an hour on MAX heat. We tried two batches, after 1 hour the dogs were warm, more than room temp, but thats it. Called the company, they said to return to Amazon, we probably have a defective unit."
2,"Evans-Wentz is to be honored as a pioneer scholar of Tibetan studies but he made some serious mistakes, including giving this book the misleading name Tibetan Book of the Dead based on the rage for the Egyptian Book of the Dead at the time. Read The Hidden History of the Tibetan Book of the Dead by Cuevas for more information. The truth is there are multiple Tibetan books and practices associated with these teachings. Do yourself a favor and explore more than this one."
2,"My daughter really loves care bears.This set is not worth the price,but my daughter loves it anyway.The swing is hard for her (and Me!) to re-attach.The figurines are also hard to place on pegs for a 3 year old as well.I really have to push them down hard.She loves the little figurines and the sounds and just the fact that it's ""Care Bears"".Disapointed in the way it's made,Seems cheap.Husband wanted to return."
2,"If you are looking for a video to watch and listen to Joshua Bell perform this DVD is not it. Joshua Bell is interviewed for about 1 minute and plays very little. The interviews of people attending the School of Violin are excellent. Joshua's Mom is also interviewed and is very interesting. The students do play a couple of pieces which are excellent, but this is not a musical video. I guess I was looking for violin concerts, with special features of interviews from the artists. To watch Joshua Bell grace a Violin is unbelievable! He will literally stop you in your tracks no matter what you are doing at the time! So I am still looking for some of Bell's videos."
2,"Very disappointing. And I thought there would be momentum building after the brilliant SoulJacker. There's nothing here to latch onto. Every song seems destined for the Shrek II soundtrack. Also, what's with the beatbox? E should realize by now what a secret weapon he has in drummer, Butch - the man grooves.I just couldn't hook into these songs. They sound like parodies of Eels compositions - like someone distilled all E's pain and suffering and found a way to package and market it. E's always had an ear for a good pop hook, but here we've got nothing but candy and sugar - where's the grit?Okay, E - so you did one for Dreamworks. Now can you do one for us again?"
2,"I ordered ""Doctor's Best Digestive Enzymes"" supplement so that I might have better digestion, less gas, and less constipation. None of these symptoms have improved so I will not order more of this product. I will contact my doctor to see if she can recommend something for remedy."
2,"I mean, an impossible plot, and an annoying cartoon character? C'mon, even a sloth could have made a better movie than this. The plot was cheesy and predictable. Stay home and watch the show instead. Not recommended"
2,"One of my kittens (both under a year old) likes this dental treat kind of, my other kitten won't eat it. I honestly don't know how Petrodex works but it's a pain to take off the paper wrapping from each piece and then crumbling it so my kittens can eat it. I won't be purchasing again."
2,"I agree with previous reviewers that these books, while engaging enough to read in one sitting, are quite off-putting. I find the author's tendency to define words annoying. I will, however, admit that I get a certain amusement from the tongue-in-cheek, understated, British humor. Granted, I am an adult with a child of my own, but I don't think I would have enjoyed this series as a kid. The books have references that are way over the heads of the recommended reading level and very disconcerting for us adults. Klaus and Sunny (von Bulow, perhaps?), I mean really! Sure, Harry Potter has a dark side, but the dark side makes sense. These books seem to be misery for misery's sake. We have enough of that in this world, without promoting it in our pre-teen children. Try reading the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series, the ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" or even ""The Hobbit."" There's plenty of trouble in all of these, but plenty of fun, too."
2,"Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden both give excellent performances in this movie. Sean Penn was believable in some scenes, over the top in others. My main complaint about this movie was that the story became totally unbelievable toward the end, and there were many flaws in the logic of the plot. I was surprised at how unrealistic the story line was, after reading so much critical praise about it."
2,It was a very compelling story of a young girl who finds out that there are many secrets in her life. I especially liked how it unraveled itself at the end.
2,this is an online game. it is no longer playable. do not buy this and expect to play it.
2,"Hi,I created a document that covers these topics for a DVD player I have.[...]Basic OutlineIssues that will be addressed:I. DVD1. DVD not burning.2. DVD not playing3. DVD not FinalizingII.

2,"Urry seemed to condense what should have been 600 pages into 150. And they were some of the hardest 150 pages I've read. Complexity theory is a fascinating topic and its application to globalization is definitely relevant. However, I found Urry very difficult to follow and I was left unconvinced. I would strongly suggest reading M. Mitchell Waldrop's book ""Complexity"" to get a much clearer perspective on the theory."
2,"Does anyone else think it's wrong that James Frey didn't serve time for the crimes he committed before he went into rehab? His mob and judge friends got him off the hook--enabling him to serve 6 months in jail instead of several years in prison. While this book was a page turner, I find it disturbing that we're glorifying (and making rich) a guy who jumped the system. He may even have been a murderer--something he never clarifies. I would respect James had he served the consequences for what he did, and actually shown some remorse for his disgusting behavior. To me, that's as much a part of rehab as getting off the substances. Instead, he wrote 22 pages of his ""sins"" and then burned them--I guess that was his payment? But this is a guy who thinks he's above everything, including the rehab program he was in. He really is his own God. People like that scare me, and it scares me that our culture is so oblivious."
2,"This book's subject matter had so much potential. Instead, it has been totally wasted. It had a chance to go into detail about the Crusades, relics, siege warfare, French village life, and life in the Courts of France. It seems like it has been dumbed down for eighth graders.Wait for it in paperback."
2,"At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on."
2,I first got turned onto Ann via her Easy Living CD WOW what arrangements nad her interrpetaions were amazing but this one is just plain dull nothing new or inspired here...just plain laid back to the point of SLEEPY.I have to agree with the other review posted by JOan its just plain syrup...such a shame because she is an awsome talent....
2,"What the heck is going on. now instead of releasing seasons or collectors edition. studios are released stripped down movies and episode mini-packs. Come On! i mean seriously, what is there to add to another Serenity dvd. last i checked there was a 2-disc collectors edition!Buy the Collectors Edition, its out, and i probably has more content."
2,I loved the design but it was not meant to withstand sun. Faded quite a bit in a year or two. Probably should not be used on a car...maybe on a binder or something.
2,"The first set of towels had to be returned as the sewing around the circumference of the towels was poorly done. Long strands thread were exposed, the type that would lead to the towel unraveling. However, the color across all towels was the same.Called Amazon service and in less than a week a new set was received. The exchange was quick, painless, and free.The second set were sewn significantly better, color was true, but as in with the first set, slightly lighter than what was pictured. However, it's close enough to my existing stuff to be acceptable.The towels aren't as plush as my mid-grade towels from BB&B;, but then again, I paid the same price for two entire towel sets from Amazon as I did for one bath towel from BB. You get what you pay for, but they're good enough.Edited 9/6/210 after the first wash in a front loader, the hand towels started to come apart. Apparently, these towels dissolve in water."
2,"Susan Orlean's magazine pieces (usually in The New Yorker) define a certain bright, glossy, mannered high standard in magazine entertainment. At best they're very fluent and well-reported, at worst they cloy and preen with a glib, narcissistic flatness that may not bug you too much until you try to read the piece a second time. (In this respect Orlean and Adam Gopnick are the Homecoming Queen and King of enamelled profundity in literary journalism.) She (or her editors) generally choose her subjects wisely, so novelty and variation disguise her remarkably narrow range. Will someone want to read this stuff in 10 or 20 years? I don't want to read them again now. Write that subscription renewal check for The New Yorker, but save the hardcover bucks for writing that isn't trapped in a self-enchanted hall of mirrors."
2,"I bought one of these, my labrador loved it, the bone on top made it easier to pick up. but the plastic that it was made of was too easy to destroy. With all the time we spent playing she always managed to destroy some part of it. It sould be tougher."
2,"M. Night Shymalan's clever plotting may have come to an end with the overly amibitious, and ultimately ridiculous The Village. Part parable, part sermon and a load of you know what, this claptrap doesn't even come close to the highs of The Sixth Sense or moments in both Unbreakable and The Signs, though with each movie, the device is wearing thin. The revelation here is Bryce Howard, who is lovely and excellent in a difficult (to put it mildly) role. The cinematography looks beautiful and the sounds provide some fun diversion, but long before this movie is over, you will be smirking in your seat."
2,"The first 60 pages describes downloading, installation and questions like ""What is Microsoft Index Server"". I bought the book to learn more about META-tags, hidded keywords and similar. Not a word about it."
2,"This is not a good album. If, like me, you decide to go back because you love ""Rise"" ... don't go this far back."
2,if I move the wave in the mirror will make me dizzy. I like the mirror but the wave in the glass is driving me crazy
2,Didn't like these at all. The fabric irritated the ear channel & the quality of the sound wasn't high. I did not find them to be noise-reducing at all.I bought them on Amazon deeply discounted & I see why the price was so appealing. 'You get what you pay for' & these were a waste of money.
2,I bought this bag for my son's back packing trip in the sierras. I have another Coleman bag that is not to big for a pack. This took up over half the pack. Way to bulky and heavy. It is probably a great car camping bag.
2,"Time ago a wrote a review for this album, but when i read it again i thought "" how could i wrote this!"" i had said that this CD was amazing! but after listening to it a couple of times i realize that this album was only a collection of eleven mediocre songs. Ashlee's first album ""Autobiography"" was much better than this, it had some beautiful lyrics but ""I Am Me"" only had poor written lyrics only talking about stupid things there are only a couple of great songs on this album, in my opinion they are: ""Say Goodbye"" and ""Catch me when i fall"" the rest of the songs disappointed me. I hope that she does a better job the next time."
2,"It works as advertized but mine died two years and three months after I bought it - and it has a two-year warranty. Tough, said the 800 number; buy another. Luckily my Platinum Mastercard doubles the manufacturer's warranty."
2,"Absolutely attrocious. After making the very solid points of buying stock in companies that have a high return on capital and a high return on investment. Then Greenblatt drones on and on. In the end, the book gives a mechanical trading system that uses absolutely no refinement. The system would have you trading in BB and OB stocks that don't event have revenues! Come on Prof G! Give us something that has some thought to it....not just a model that worked. And, OBTW, he never ""future tested"" the model. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This book is of no consequence to readers who are interested in investing shrewdly."
2,Even tho it says 8 inches.... My revereware pan is 8 inches and larger. I got it for my son and was disappointed in the skimpy size and felt it was really thin. It does not compare well with my Revere ware pan which I could not find one like anywhere so settled for this one!
2,"I hate giving bad reviews because I don't want to hurt anyones feelings, but this broke after just 5 minutes after it was mounted on the garage wall. I'm assuming that it's not meant to be screwed to a wall? Anyhow, it was never allowed to be enjoyed. It was cute, though."
2,"The seediness and depravity of the New Orleans wards so beautifully depicted in the Robicheaux novels does not transplant to rural Montana well, nor without laying bare the formula that underlies most of Burke's books. A host of psychopaths, degenerates and Mafiosos mix with a stage full of psychologically damaged innocents and not so innocents including the trademark flawed ex-lawman and his violence prone pal. Burke's gift for flowery agreeable prose which in past outings has raised this genre fiction to the threshold of literature here fails to camouflage the obvious retrofit that is Dave Robicheaux of New Iberia reborn as Billy Bob Holland in Montana. Two thirds into the story and the work seems to have degenerated into an aimless daisy-chain of one violent confrontation linking to the next act of heartless cruelty, all involving characters who are difficult to care about."
2,"If you want to know the mechanics of your body and how it integrates(or doesn't integrate food), there are much better and informative books out there. One really great one: YOU On a Diet by Mehmet Oz, MD. It also is easy to read, understand and has a sense of humor.This book is VAGUELY informative and chock full of very un-funny humor.I just think one could do much better."
2,"There was a time when I would purchase any new David Bowie album without hearing a single track from it beforehand. This is the album that broke me of that habit. :-( Having been a fan (at this particular point in time) for 25 years, that's rather sad. ""Outside"" was one of the most disappointing albums I've ever heard. Bowie's venture into industrial metal should never have taken place. Despite the fact that 9-Inch Nails would have no career without the influence of David Bowie, the reciprocal situation does not work so well. I really only liked one track, a revamped ""Strangers When We Meet"" (originally recorded for ""The Buddha of Suburbia"" soundtrack). Even the most die-hard of Bowie fans (such as myself) might find this album not up to David's usual par."
2,"I guess in the fifties this must have been exciting but in that respect it doesn't stand the test of time. I found it mildly interesting as I might find a museum piece or a bit of social history: Britain in the age when rationing was still in force. And of course, it's always of interest to see stalwarts of the British post war movie industry doing their thing but there are so much better films to watch than this. It represents something of a decline for Howard when set against masterpieces like Carol Reed's The Third man or David Lean's Brief Encounter and neither does it stand comparison with Hitchcock's early British thrillers with which it's been bracketed.As a nostalgia piece it's okay but great cinema it aint!"
2,"I found that Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita failed to live up to hype, mostly because of the writing style and the dated content. The story is written in classic Russian style: confusing points of reference, an abundance of minutia and too many characters. I could never get into and wondered at the point of it all. It might have been entertaining in a phantasmagorical sort of way in the mid 20th century, but turns out to be slow and tame by today's standards. Despite numerous attempts, I've never been able to get into Russian literature; something to consider about the reviewer."
2,"And I only use that term because I feel that this movie is exactly that. The entire Qudditch World Cup took place in less than 2 minutes when in the book, it lasted chapters!!! In Sorcerer's Stone they spent hours on stupid details the moviegoer didn't need, but nooo. In Goblet, they can't even put in the veelas! (What's up with that? Fleur's 1/2 veela, come ON!) And they totally left out the sphenix in the maze. This movie is NOT that good, so just rent it people, please.Kendall"
2,"I enjoyed the author's method of writing, and his vivid descriptions were wonderful. I was somewhat satisfied with the book until the last few chapters when things just got, well...stupid. I think each character was beautifully written, but the way they were brought together was uncreative. I was appalled with the simple ending to this book. I fumbled throught the entire book hoping for a decent amount of closure, but was left disappointed. In all I applaud the author for his characterization and style, but I would ask him to sit a little longer next time thinking of a more solid plot."
2,"The book itself was in good shape but it took too long to get it. Although it came within the time suggested, there was no way to tack it even though it took weeks to received after it supposedly shipped. I ended up buying the book somewhere else and returning this one when it finally came."
2,"I read this book and at best it is simply entertaining, hence the two stars, otherwise it would be only one star. I do not believe this woman's story. She admits to having been treated for brain damage and mental problems due to an auto accident she was in. I'm sure anyone who is medicated for brain problems could invent such a story. She claims God is very personal to her and comes to her in visions, this I find unbelievable, not unbelievable in a ""wow"" way, but unbelievable in a "" I don't think so"" way. If you are looking to be entertained this book is ok, but I'd rather rent Star Wars for entertainment."
2,"After having purchased a Garage door bottom rubber from Home Depot that turned out not to work I checked Amazon and found what I thought was exactly what I needed.The picture was identical to the bottom rubber I had taken off, but when the M-D product arrived, it was not what the picture showed, in fact it was exactly the same asthe one I had gotten from Home Depot.Buyer beware when looking at the pictures that accompany the products."
2,"I didn't want to believe it when I first listened to it but it was true. St. Anger is possibly one of the worst albums Metallica has ever made. And what's even more sad is how many more new fans they have because of this album and they love it. I give this two stars because although it was a horrible album, there maybe two good tracks; Frantic and The Unnamed Feeling. The rawness of the production was there, reminiscent of their earlier recordings like Kill 'Em All, but it can't compare to that album at all. The live DVD was a nice little feature that had all of the songs played live in Metallica's HQ, but it still doesn't save the crappiness of the songs. If you must buy the album, buy it used or steal it or download it to piss off Lars, it's not worth the full price."
2,"these diapers are basicly the same as a size 1 but the problem is that you can't get something comapable to a size 2 , I ordered size 3 after these no longer fit and the things are huge and constantly leak .hope pampers sees this and goes back to old sizing because pampers are the best for leaks etc but this stupid 1-2 combo is insane !!!"
2,"Html turns out to be two languages. There's html, a language that browsers display, and html, a theoretical standard designed by a committee, which no actual browsers display. If you're designing Web pages for people to look at, it's a reference to the former that you need. This book is not it.I bought this book because I want to make Web pages people can look at on actual browsers. Instead I find sentences like ""HTML 4.0 has standardized the many extensions and introduced new solutions. It's the browsers that now need to catch up.""This is a frightening sentence to read in a reference work. In fact, if you find yourself writing a sentence like this while writing a work of purported non-fiction, it's a sign that Something is Wrong."
2,"I am in my junior year of high school and am in the midst of reading this novel. I, along with my classmates, am finding it a very hard book to get into. The character Jim's speech is hard to interpret unless you read aloud and by the time you figure out what he is trying to say, you are very bored. I am told this novel is an American classic. Well, I wonder why I should have to read it then, not only am I Canadian, I also have more interest, being a teenager, in the present. I understand the themes residing in this novel and that they are very important issues and I recognize why it's a classic, but I don't understand why high schoolers should be forced to read it, or any other out-dated classic either."
2,"Extremely poor technical support. I have contacted bulldog several times via phone and left messages. If you call the wait time is extremely long and you can leave a voice message with your phone number and they will call you back, right??? I have sent multiple e-mails, received back nothing. If you expect support troubleshooting any issues this is not the product to buy. Packaging was very damaged as well."
2,"This machine is wonderful, however it took me two machines to find that out. The smell in the machine when you first get it horrible. You absolutely must clean the machine using the cleaning cycle at least 10 times before you use the ice from it. On my first machine I used the cleaning cycle 3 times and still did not get rid of the odor (which permeates your ice, by the way). I finally had to use straight white vinegar in the cleaning cycle to get the odor out. On top of that, I used an air purifier aimed directly into the machine for several hours. That put a high ozone content in there to eat up the chemical odor that is in the plastic. I finally have a machine that works."
2,The quality of this DVD is incredibly poor. Looks like a direct transfer froma well worn 16mm print. Not much else to say.He Is My Brother
2,I did not like this Falt Iron because there was no way to regulate the temperature- I was afraid to burn my hair
2,"This book is well organized, but quite elitist and grim in its presentation of the topic. According to Mr. Morgan, warriors are an elite class, better than the rest of us mortals, evidently, and the only honorable way to live is to engage in seaseless struggle. There is nothing here about creating a more compassionate peaceful society, and no analysis of the ravages of war created by persuing a relentlessly militiristic model. Sure, we all need to discover our warrior capabilities, but we don't need more vigilantes in this society!"
2,"When this unit worked it was great. However, it only lasted for 10 months and stopped working. Kind of a high price for something to last less than a year."
2,"I've been a devoted Stevie Wonder fan since the early 70's but I feel most of the songs on his new album are rather mediocre and somewhat boring (although a couple truly will make you dance!). His voice isn't what it used to be, although he continues to be a master musician. He tries to cram too many lyrics into each song, and only a few of the cuts have memorable melodies. Still, it's good to have him back in the studio recording new songs."
2,Where has no limit gone??? The old tru is about real gangsta $*%#!!! This is wack. No Limit needs to remember where they came from. They came from the projects and they do not make good rich people. what happened to killin and slangin to make money. Come on P!! The only real soulja's you have now is mystikal and c-murder. And even c-murder is gettin weak!!! Lets get it together P. Make us say ugggg again!!!
2,"I heard ""The Adventure"" and really liked it. I can't really say the same for the rest of the CD. A lot of people seem to love it and that's great; I'm just not one of those people. In my opinion, the songs all sound the same, and with the exception of ""The Adventure"" just aren't very good. It sounds like some kind of futuristic, progressive sounding experiment in music and I think it would have been better if it was just more rock. However, I would have settled for it just being more...good."
2,"Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" version is not much more than pretty window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."
2,"The great thing about this body groomer is that it's waterproof and stays charged for nearly an hour. That's about it, though. Whether my hair was wet or dry, I just didn't have much luck. Any part of your body that you shave, you'll have to go over it again and again. I'm not the hairiest boy alive but by the time I spent 50 minutes with it, I could have gotten a closer shave with a Gillette Mach 3 or any other 3 bladed razor. I haven't tried the BG2030 model yet, but it has to be an improvement over this one. Overall, it's a great concept but a flawed product."
2,I own this pan and the 12 inch lodge skillet. I love the lodge pan and I am about to get rid of this one in place of a smaller lodge. I refuse to use teflon so exclusively use cast iron instead. My lodge pan and a smaller cast iron skillet I have from the 1950s get used every day but this one just sits because everything sticks and it is really hard to clean.
2,"This is an entertaining novel, but if you change the names, places, events, location, times, and characters identiites; then its called Fiction, not non-fiction. Mr. Carcartarra story has been investigated by several investigators and there are numerous holes in his story. His friend the ""Lawyer"" was interviewed and he has never taken on a murder trial and then lost it. Also, the two hoodlum friends were obviously a composite of some of the characters from the Westies gang. It would be fairly easy to spot who these people are, seeing how Organized crime is documented so extensiveley. And the ringer, the Priest. The Priest that was at the Authors school, never testified at any trial. Pure Fiction."
2,"This book was painfully awful. I have read several of Zane's books in the past, none are what I would call literary masterpieces, but they are entertaining nonetheless. This book was not even up to Zane's standards! It was slow from beginning to end, with idiotic plots and subplots. I won't spoil it, but the surprises at the end are not even surprises. The only real situations were that of Janessa and D'vonte. I could relate to their drama. But Temptest and Geran...get a life and give me a break. I would not recommend this book to anyone!"
2,"This item was sent instead of the ISBN number that I punched in. It is much larger than what I ordered. I wanted the smaller version. I never gave it a thought that your system would bring other books up other than the number requested. I do appreciate the fact shipping was provided to send the item back, but am very hesitant to reorder."
2,"In beta this game was great because it had PvP in it, but when there were a few weeks left of beta, they took out PvP. Yes the PvP system was super buggy in beta but instead of trying to fix it they became lazy and just took it out which was a very bad mistake. No PvP means a boring game once you reach the highest level cause there really is nothing left to do other than kill monsters, trade, and talk to other players which easily gets boring. If you have love for PvP like me then get Asheron's Call 2 or Dark Age of Camelot though those games aren't futuristic like this one, they have extremely good PvP. If you only want to play futuristic MMORPGs then wait for Star Wars Galaxies to come out. It's funny if how they just left PvP in this game then I would have rated it 5 stars, sadly they [messed] up because of their laziness. This is all I had to say."
2,"If you have brought other books by this author you will know how great they are, but this is a disappointment. it is not a jewellery freferance book but a book of quotes."
2,"i read this for our book club. I have many relatives from Russia. There was not enough history for an historic novel. Way too much description of The Hermitage art. Not enough about WWII history in Russia. The book should describe when Marina gave birth to Andrei, and how she left Russia. I will not read another book by Debra Dean. Few people in our book club liked this book. It was recommended by two artists. Maybe artists would enjoy the myriad descriptions of Hermitage madonnas."
2,"Though built upon a promising premise, this collection of short tales woven around a single ""lost"" Vermeer painting gets off to an objectionable start that I found difficult to get over. The suggestion hinted at by the ending of the first story, that somehow the painting itself should be destroyed because it had once been stolen by a Nazi, is unconscionable. A work of art acquires no inherent guilt through the actions of those who handle it; the suggestion is all the more inappropriate given the Nazis' own penchant for destroying art.Otherwise, most of the stories in the book were originally written and published separately, and this perhaps accounts for their somewhat uneven execution. I found the two middle stories, ""Morningshine"" and ""From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers"" to be the most compelling tales in the book, each more for the personal stories they tell than any protagonism of the painting itself."
2,This is a very flat recitation of anecdotes of the Nixon presidency. In the first few pages we are reminded that Nixon was a brooding loner. The rest of the book provides supporting material.
2,"Just a warning: While the video is OK, I can give only two stars to this set because I am hearing impaired and need subtitles or closed captions, neither of which are available on these discs. I feel they are considerably over-priced without these features. If you can hear fine, you probably will enjoy this set.(This is true of the season 2 set as well.)"
2,The bookWill Natalie's book get published? Only time will tell.The School Story is about a girl named Natalie who want's to get her book published with the help of her friend Zoe and her teacher Ms. Clayton They help her publish her book.My favorite chapter of the book is when Ms. Clayton buys a rental office. She is going to use the office for Zoe. This is my favorite chapter because it is one of the longest chapters. I enjoy these because I learn a lot about the characters and the author uses a lot of detail.I think that the author's purpose is to teach kids to never give up and keep on trying because Natalie never gave up and kept on trying.I would recommend this book to someone who likes to write because it's about a good book.
2,"worked as advertised. I did receive a larger size than expected as another reviewer mentioned, it is indeed 18x7. The reason for 2 stars is it just stopped working out of the blue after just 2 months and 2 days."
2,"I was so excited to get these suction bowls, but they dont suction very well. I wouldnt buy this again"
2,"When these came out a few years ago I bought one right away. Unfortunately it leaked around the base quite significantly. A few months later I bought another one, hoping it would be better. It leaked even worse.This one may be a new and improved model but I'm afraid to buy it -- I've already wasted $180 on two that didn't work well."
2,"This is practicly a made for TV movie. It was obviously filmed in the 1970s because of their clothes, cars, and lifestyles. Don't be fooled like I was; the review said there was lesbian sex in the movie; not even close. I got it because I'm one of those guys that like to watch lesbian sex and I was gravely disapointed. It has pretty women in it, but you never see much. Sigh, I didn't waste too much money."
2,i bought this product because i needed a car charger but the cord which is the most thing needed doesn't work i thought it was nice cause i could change the length of th e cord but it doesn't work!!!!!! but I love the car charger it woarks perfectly and so does the plug in part.
2,i really wanted to like this movie.the trailer looked fantastic.but instead of focusing on the aerial exploits of these heroes the film gets bogged down with a love story between one of the main charactors and a local girl and his inability to follow orders.the special effects are good and the dogfights are good when they are there.
2,"As stated in previous reviews, this cabinet is mostly easy to assemble, with the exception of the corner brackets. Impossible to screw in those corner brackets when the cabinet is assembled. Plus, the screws are very cheap screws that are not wood screws. There is a significant gap between the drawers once assembled. One of the drawers does not slide well and seems to slip off its track occasionally. The color of the cabinet is nice but the finish is not done well. I feel I need to be very careful pulling out the drawers as the cabinet just does not feel very sturdy. If you want a file cabinet that looks pretty, is fairly economical compared to other non-metal file cabinets, and won't be used often, this may still be an acceptable choice."
2,"I had hoped to find some overalls I could garden in, but these things are so heavy that they are uncomfortable and way too hot. I guess they would be great for a late fall clean-up in the yard, but forget them for summer."
2,I was looking forward to reading this book and when I finally did it was a let down. It's not scary. It seems to be written to scare children rather than to inspire chills or midnight scrambling to turn on all the light in the house.Read his book Quit Your Job and move to Key West. Now that's a great book!
2,"I'm very sad, this movie is not playing correctly!! :( The voice and picture don't match up and are playing not in sync ONE bit!! :P"
2,"this thing is awful, all it is is the pilot episode for the series they are going to have on ABC soon. The character animation is all off, even stitch, who you'd think they'd realize was the most important character was done wrong for most of the film. Jumba, nani and David all look wrong as well. If you were looking for a sequel to the WONDERFUL original film, move on, because this ain't it. It's disney's new version of Pokemon. If you're just out for more of the stitch attitude, at least he shines through from time to time."
2,"I enjoyed this tape but was disappointed when I discovered thatit was the same as the video tape entitled Rodeo Bloopers. I like alittle variety and I expected to see something different on each tape, not the same exact film."
2,"The product came in on time, the packaging itself was giving a very China made kind of feeling. We still did not lose confidence and assembled the handles of the cooker. Even that was also not very clearly explained in the manual. The handle on the lower pot has just one screw that attached it to the pot and the handle on the lid had two screws!! A Major design flaw. The pot has to hold a lot of weight with food in it and needed a firm support. So once the cooker was assembled, we tried lifting it empty the lower pot handle felt as it will yield to the pressure of the hand was not sturdy enough. It did not take us more than 5 minutes to realize that we have made a wrong choice and the product needs to be returned before it is too late. So here we are returning the Presto 6 Qt Stainless Steel pressure cooker. We figured that may be it is a better choice to add 20-30 bucks to your budget and go for a sophisticated decent brand."
2,"I paid no too much for this product but their capabilities were not enough for me because: having a power load about 35% I just have around 6 mins backup time and no 120min full-load as offered; has no external mute botton and every time you need to turn this sound off you must to connect the PC to do it thru the SW; it has no internal voltage regulator (just can define low/high limits where the battery will start to work); the WinXP SW sometimes doesn't work and for this you couldn't monitor&control the device, to do it you will need to restart the computer; you have no protected power outleet included and this make you to add an extra outleet to your wall if you need to feed no protected devices. Is not the best product for 1500VA, but for this prices is the only want you could find!!"
2,I am half-way through the book and I am finding it: boring. There really is nothing to it. Don't waste your money.
2,"This cd is a waste of money.It does not give her voice any credit. The songs are poor there are only 3 maybe 4 decent songs on this whole entire album.All the skits do nothing but pad the album. With better material, more voice training she can be a good singer. Right now, she's just a studio singer.I am mad that I brought this album. I wanted to give her a chance because she's a newer singer and the first album was decent but this album goes the range of the other sophmore albums by new artist.WEAK AS ALL H-LL!"
2,"I agree with reviewer(achaean)about this book. When will people stop believing in myths. First of all the devil is a concept that comes from Zoroastrian ideas. It is a myth to keep people in fear and control. Look around, works real well. Next 666 has nothing to do with the devil. It is a number associated with the sun. Get it(sun of man). If people would do their research and stop having preconceived notions and beliefs in their heads when looking for answers,we would not be having this problem. It all goes back to the Ego and control of others. 666 and the Devil are the best tools on the market to envoke fear and hate towards others and the unknown......Why 2 stars???? For the overall amusement of such ridiculous ideas with no proof to back them up...."
2,"Just a small custard tart with a tiny bit of Canadian bacon on top. I like the bacon to be in the custard (and crisp), and that's the classical defintion, so this was disappointing to me, since I ordered it from San Francisco where I could not find good ones."
2,"Read consumer feedback FIRST! The ring looks better online than it does in reality. Apparently this jewelry is supposed to be ""Tiffany inspired""? But for this particular item, more like Tiffany's sister.....I kept the ring though because I needed a blue-stoned pinky ring. It fulfills its purpose....for now....In general, I find that the Eve's Addiction simulated stone rings are overpriced for the cheap-looking creations you end up getting. Their stainless steel line is great though, that's your better bet."
2,he got talent but in this album he just do't show .this cd got some really great songs that are worth listining. he didn't rhyme like in his new cd's cocky or one before that history of rock
2,"I have to say I was very disappointed with this product. It will remove peach fuzz type of hair just fine, but not the coarse hair most people want removed. I still have to tweeze! - isn't there a product out there that works?"
2,"The Donegan Pocket Magnifier is of acceptable Quality. Themagnification of each of the two lenses is about the same.An oportunity has been missed; My other pocket magnifiers havelenses of substantially different powers. This gives me threeuseful magnifications: Each individual lense, and then theircombination."
2,"I purchased this item as it looked very nice. Three weeks after having it the finish in the bird bath bowl started lifting and peeling. As it is only plastic paint over a plastic bowl and stand,the water sitting in the bowl is causing the paint finish to lift. So with time the whole bowl will be black in color. I guess I will have to put blue glass stones in the bowl so the birdies will know what it is. For $30.00+ including, keep you money in your pocket is my recommendation!!!!"
2,"I really wanted to likethis. Visually, the film is like a Ghibli film, Lush,detailed backgrounds, and Miyazaki like character designs. But that's as far as it goes. The story, a journey to a hidden mystical land, is just all over the place, and the characters are just bland. Nobody stands out.I can scarcely remember what i'd seen..."
2,"The book could definitely have been better. I expected better of the author. I have read several of her other books and all of them were excellent. Color of Love was fantastic! And I picked up this book only because I was excited to read Ms. Kitt's latest novel, I didn't even read the back cover. Her latest effort was a disappointment but I'm sure her next one won't."
2,"The movie, in my opinion, had no point.It was ridiculously depressing and leaves the audience thinking..""What the [heck] did I watch that for?!"" Although Robby Benson is staggeringly good-looking, don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie!"
2,"Pardon the pun, but I am tired of the bait and switch moves by film distributors when it comes to DVD releases. You buy the 25th anniversary disc and low and behold, they release a 30 year version, with nary a tempting extra. Those reviews that give this a 5 star or close to it, you're suckers, all of ya! This release hardly has anything the 25 year version didn't. Maybe a longer featurette. And then there will be the 35 year version, with one extra deleted scene, I bet ya. Anyway, save your money, buy the 25 year unless you can't find it. And by the way, I give the movie itself 5 stars for sure!"
2,"I'll make this short and sweet, the novel was disapointing because; 1. She made Lestate in to some kind of Indestructable God? I mean how farther can she go with this character? 2. There were to many flaws in the story-line."
2,"At first, this drive seemed just what I was looking for. I plugged it in and It Just Worked. So I immediately set about copying a bunch of stuff from my unofficial backup system (a big pile of CD-R's) to my new drive.After about 20 minutes of this, a high-pitched ""Eeeeeeeeeee"" sound started coming from the drive. My wife noticed it too. So did our dog - the high pitch caused canine conniptions.I disconnected and powered off the drive. Blessed silence. I tried again after a couple of hours. Quiet at first, but soon enough ""Eeeeeeeeeeeeee"" once again.I spent a day or so wondering if I could put up with this over the long term, and decided against it. Back to Amazon it went, and my money was promptly refunded. I bought another drive from AcomData, 160gb, for the same price as this one, and now I'm a happy camper.Maybe I just got a bad apple; most of the other reviews on this seem positive."
2,"I cannot believe after waiting for one year for this book how disappointed I was when I read it. Yes, some of the character development or lack thereof was interesting and the pregnancy scare was a nice plot point the rest of it just didn't seem to go anywhere. Get it from the Library if you can or at least wait until the paperback version comes out. Really not worth the $20+. Sorry Laurell but you've lost another long time fan."
2,"The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector. It claims it doesn't slow down your typing speed at all, but it really does; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so. As I'm typing this review now, I'm not using my protector anymore. If you don't mind how it slows down your typing, then go ahead and get it."
2,"yes Channing is good looking, not that u see that much of him, its not that well filmed, very amateur at times, i'm sure that what they are going for. very B grade stripping, once again part of the story but still doesn't make it very good to watch."
2,"Agree with the other reviewers who criticize the way they fit (don't fit) at the waist. While they feel and generally fit like quality Levis,they are more low-rise than I expected or like and I am constantly pulling them up.."
2,"If this set had cost $29.99 and contained only three or four discs, I wouldn't feel nearly as cheated. The commentaries introducing the episodes were repetitive and mainly lamented the scarcity of Adrian Paul. Since the introductory commentaries had been one of the best parts of the previous five seasons' DVDs, this is a major drawback.The episodes auditioning a format for RAVEN weren't that bad in and of themselves, but they weren't HIGHLANDER. The finale was good and pulled together the best threads of the previous seasons (I would have liked Xavier St Cloud included, but still...)I was also disappointed that, though Elizabeth and Peter were featured in the opening credits of the sixth season, there weren't Methos and/or Amanda centered episodes, except for the Joe & Methos one.There were 4 discs that contained NOTHING that couldn't have been added to the first 4. Only for people who really have to have the completes series."
2,"I must say I was very disapointed with this film. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high, or my sense of humor is way different then those who made this film. Either way, I would suggest that you rent it first before buying.I thought much more could have been done with the independent film. I felt the acting could have been better as well as better props and sets. However, it's obvious that the director has a knowledge of Bond films. The names of the characters as well as the plot were very ""Bondish"".Being a musician, I was impressed with the theme song. I thought that was just great. But other than the cool tune and the opening credit sequencing I was disapointed."
2,Camera work was ok but besides that this was a storyline that went nowhere. Kept waiting for something to be pieced together and it never did.
2,"I was looking for a film for my family that would be a moving true to life spiritual drama of the Apostle Peter's life and the last supper. I appreciate the producers efforts but they didn't have to mix fiction so much with the facts...Scripture alone is beautiful why they felt like they had to doctor things up so much, I don't know. While watching it I had to point out to my daughter the parts that were in scripture and the parts that were not...I just didn't want her watching the movie without knowing...This was annoying. I wish I could find another dramatization of the Apostle Peter's life. One that would stay more true to scripture and biographical facts...Something with a holy feel and good dramatization...Anyways, God bless the movie producers of this film. At least they tried..."
2,Wish I had known it shipped deflated... this is a toys for tots gifts and now I have to find a way to inflate the ball before donating.
2,the sophomore album falls deeply beneath my expectation. on the first album the band distinguished and differentiated itself with the great energy radiating from each song. i'm sorry to admitt that i can't sense that anymore. i'm throwing a second star in appreciation for the improved melodies.
2,"The structure is a little wobbly, and it says you can use the double dome light fixture with it, but it only has a place to run one cord, so the other is left dangling and it doesn't look very good."
2,"Interviews are O.K. However, two hours worth is a little too much. The four ""musical"" tracks featured on this CD are very old, pre-Ed Sullivan Beatles songs. Although I am glad that Pete Best is getting some recognition. Let's face it, the very early Beatles weren't the musical giants they turned out to be in 1964, and afterwards. The early Beatles were crude and rough, just learning their ""chops.""This ""interview CD"" is also a bit contradictory. The title is ""Savage Young Beatles."" However, Disc 2 features one of the last interviews that John and Yoko conducted. This is very misleading.Talk is fine. But, I would like to have a little more singing from the best band in history. I would definitely avoid this CD -- unless you are an absolute Beatles fanatic who needs to own everything with their name on it. Then again, if this is the case, you wouldn't care what I have to say; you will buy it anyway."
2,"Doyles section is basically the same and is why it got 2 stars in the first place. I feel the poker pros were not used properly for this book. Daniel negranu is a coward for doing three card draw that has no merit on real card tables and he should of just declined it in the first place,he is a no limit and omaha 8 or better expert and should of wrote on that instead. Bobby baldwin was the most sound poker player during his time, kind of like alan cunningham of today. So I dont know why he didnt write the limit chapter again, I think modern day limit players would have really been in for a treat. I have nothing against jeniffer harmen writing it but I think it was better served for baldwin. Please save your money and dont buy this book. If need be they should have it at your local library."
2,"The dictionary was ordered 12/16/11 (free shipping), and was to be included with other items that were received around the 22nd. It was not included with the shipment so it did not arrive for Christmas giving. After following up with Amazon, the item was received within a week. This is not the basis for the 2-star rating.The large-print edition of the dictionary contained too few words that are not commonly known and the brief definitions of the words were insufficient as to elaboration. The dictionary was of little use to us and I have returned the item for refund."
2,3 days after I received it the wind knocked it off the chain and it fell to the ground and shattered! I guess $60 dosen't buy unbreakable plastic.
2,"I've been a Weird Al fan for some time now and after reading all the reviews here on amazon I was really excited to hear his newest release. Unfortunately, the album does not justify the hype. White & Nerdy is an impressive starting song, but pancreas is a bit of a let down, it just feels like he's done a song or two just like it on past albums. Candian Idiot is alright, but I'll Sue Ya is a really boring and poor excuse for a Rage Against The Machine (style) paradoy. Polkarama was alright. Virus Alert was kinda funny. Convessions Part III is about as exciting as the R&B song that it parody's. Weasel Stomping Day is stupid and a little gross. Close But No Cigar is completely forgettable. Do I Creep You Out was pretty good. I liked it. The rest of the songs were decent and I haven't watched the bonus items but I doubt they can make up for so many disappointing songs."
2,"If your over the age of 12... then this is definitely not a CD for you. Filled with remakes of 50s/60s songs and a few new ""jams"", this CD makes you laugh more than anything else. Aaron Carter is a product of his record company. He has no say whatsoever as to what he sings or how the music sounds. Basically they hand him a sheet, say ""sing this"", and he does it. They ask him to smile... snap a few photos... go on a few TV shows and WHAM! your a star. There are a lot more harder working musicians who you should spend you money on. Let Aaron grow up and then maybe he should try again."
2,I bought this product to try and save a little money but found that it was a wash. I first bought one on craigslist and it didn't work. Then I though that maybe someone sold me a bad modem and bought one on Amazon. I work but was too much of a hard time to get it to work. I found that my carrier didn't recognize the modem and had to call and sit on the phone while they configure it for their network. After getting knocked of tones of times I gave up and bought the surfboardGO WITH THE SURF. AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND TROUBLE.
2,"the Kindle version I downloaded kept crashing after I got about halfway through. After several failed attempts, I finally gave up trying to download a new version, and ended up asking for a refund, which Amazon provided."
2,"This book is about the story of two people who have been married for 14 years and who under incredible stress and circumstances find themselves being separated and losing their marriage.I don't think the story holds very well, you can predict the end a lot sooner than it takes the author to do it. The characters are very predictable.All in all, I don't think this is Danielle Steel's best."
2,"I was disappointed with this product. It was very bland tasting. Also, straws were not included which makes it very hard to use in lunches and on the go."
2,"I bought this item used, so I expected it to have some wear and tear as in normal use. I expected it to be like a well read library book. Instead, I got a book that was badly stained as if something has been spilled on it. The condition was marked as ""good"" but I feel like I need to disinfect after touching it. At least the price was good."
2,"I used to be a big Van Damme fan. Timecop, Hard Target and Lionheart are still among my favorite action movies. However, recent Van Damme's movies are rather weak. It is my personal opinion that without a interesting original script and quality professional actors portraying the ""bad guys"" Van Damme's movies aren't' worth the time nor money.Brief comments about this movie - very [poor] story, much weaker than Segal's Under Siege 2 Dark Territory. Some sickening pictures portraying Small Pox outbreak. Supporting cast, excluding Tomas Arana, Laura Harring, range from weak to complete amateurs. Also, special effects are very weak.On the positive, if you love Van Damme, you will see him doing his usual stuff in the movie. Also, his son makes a theatrical debut with some nice martial art moves.Overall, I would rather watch again one of my favorite Van Damme movies than this one."
2,"I was pulled into the book immediately, felt sympathy for Joe and great interest in what would happen next. Initially it was a real page-turner. What happened was the book deteriorated into metaphysical twaddle and I reluctantly plodded through the last section. Very disappointing."
2,"Interesting that nobody's mentioned this.. After install, it says you must insert the CD rom. Being a download, obviously this is impossible. What gives?"
2,"well though I think that new players will benifit from the use of these products ,I belive that older players will find that these decks and in general the entire expansions lack skill ,power, and strategy the game used to have. These cards and sets are an insult to the game, and anyone who uses them and cannot build there own decks and put some thought and strategy behind it should stop and play a baby game like yugi oh. For all those who don't know of what i speak, find some alpha, beta, unlimited, revised,and arabian nights cards. You gotta earn the right to call yourself a magic player."
2,nothing you can't find online for free on any design blog. only worth buying if you are buying second hand.
2,It was flimsy and the tilt adjustment didn't lock in place very securely. I had to use cable ties to keep it from slipping out when the tray gets bumped from below by your knees. Poor design and manufacture.
2,"No idea what this movie was supposed to make me think. It was so weird that I don't even know how to describe it.All I can say: the plot was predictable. Like three minutes in and I already knew what was going to happen. And yet it was really weird. I mean, what was the point? Totally strange...I would not suggest this movie."
2,This unit spans the FM spectrum; in a metro area where the spectrum full; the unit fails. Bottom line is don't buy this or any other FM transmitter if you are going to try and use it in a large metro area where all the FM frequencies are so closely space that there is not one of them open for the unit to work. If on the other hand you live in a remote area (like the desert) well then go right ahead.
2,"I bought this bag because I love the look and durability of Domke bags. I am a photojournalist and I have used Domke photo bags for a long time. I was very excited to get another Domke for my new computer. Unfortunately, my 15.6"" HP sticks almost 2 inches above the top of the padded insert, rendering the bag near useless for protection. A 15"" Macbook Pro sticks out about 1.5 inches. Other than that, great bag. But most newer wide-screen 15"" laptops stick well out of the top of the padded insert. Definitely a deal breaker for a laptop bag. If you have a 13"" or smaller computer it would make a great bag. They shouldn't advertise it as a 15"" laptop bag."
2,"I expected this charm to be much bigger and didn't think to check the measurements when it popped up as my search for a ""four leaf clover key chain."" It is EXTREMELY small. about the size of my finger nail. So if that is what you are looking for than this is the purchase for you. If you were looking for a key chain as I was don't waste your money. It barely fits on my key ring."
2,"Rod Stewart is by far one of the best rock male vocalists in my book. However, re-doing these ""classics"" just doesn't gel with me. For some reason, they all sound alike with hardly any variation. If I had to pick one good track, it would have to be ""If Not For You"", originally done by George Harrison (speaking of which, check out Olivia Newton John's remake of this song-much better than Rod's). Perhaps Rod should have tried some original rock tunes instead (but then they wouldn't be classics, now right?). I love all of these songs performed by the original artists. I think Rod could have done these songs justice...he has a great voice to pull it off, but the arrangements are stale in my opinion. I almost pre-purchased the CD, but glad I waited until after hearing the samples. I will not be buying this one...sorry!"
2,"That's the morbid curiosity that brought me to purchase this CD. I guess I just wanted to hear this band try to put these songs over as their own. Frightening. I mean, really, it's not that it's BAD, but how can ANYONE but Burton Cummings sing these songs as ""The Guess Who?""One play and filed along with the multitudes of [junk] that I keep for amusement.Definitely stay away from this one if you really want ""The Guess Who"" but definitely grab it if you want to watch them pull the bodies out of the flaming car from the other side of the road."
2,"While in Egypt, Peter and Freddie (Abbott and Costello) get involved with a walking mummy, his cult followers, and a cursed medallion.That's a pretty short summary, but honestly, that's all there is to this disappointing comedy. Abbott and Costello were past their prime in 1955 and the film shows it. The jokes aren't much unless you think endless punchlines with ""mummy"" instead of ""mommy"" and snake charmers with rubber snakes are funny. Abbott yells too much at Costello and they both are barely going through the motions; in fact, they call each other ""Bud"" and ""Lou"" throughout. The ridiculous casting of Richard Deacon (""Mel Cooley"" inThe Dick Van Dyke Show) and Michael Ansara (TV's ""Cochise"") as Egyptian mummy-worshippers makes the story even more far-fetched. It's about thirty minutes too long and plays like a bad SNL skit. Definitely not one of their best."
2,"Very disappointed, but felt it was my own fault. I expected the lovely music from ""Death in Venice"", but all I found was one very dirgy side, and a ridiculous side which would be more suited to people studying music as a career. For me not a good choice, but so be it."
2,"The author has the right idea. He does understand how dangerous the theory of evolution is. The problem is, his whole book could be summed up in 1 chapter. He just keeps hammering the same thing over and over about the evils of evolution. WE KNOW! That why I bought the book. Unfortunately, it had no useful information about scientific evidence of creationism (it is out there, but for some strange reason, he didn't put any in the book!) So, basically this is a ""pump-up, go get em"" kind of book, which is not what I wanted."
2,"The movie itself is wonderful, so please don't let my review stop you from buying The Polar Express movie. However, the inside of this DVD case was cracked. As a result, the actual DVD flops around inside the case. There is no way the inside got cracked without a mark on the outside of the case. Someone picked up this DVD, realized the DVD was loose on the inside, and they simply didn't care. I left a negative review with Amazon the day after we received the DVD, and I requested a new case or an exchange. They NEVER got back to me. The DVD will definitely be scratched and in a few months."
2,"I found the formulas to be too exotic. Most of the ingredients are very expensive. I was also dissapointed that natural preservatives were not discussed. The thought of someone keeping their lotion in the refrigerator is an inconvenience. I want to sell my concoctions, and that can't be done without preservatives."
2,"I was disappointed in this book. I loved Ms Krahn's early books but althought this book made me laugh at times I was annoyed by the lead female. She was very un-pleasantly stubborn and down right stupid sometimes and the plot of finding long lost scrolls was contrived and not very believable. I loved the hard hitting hero but the female character was dreary and not very smart, he deserved better."
2,The outside of this thermos is enormous while at the same time it doesn't hold that much inside. From 8am to noon food cools down to the point where it is luke warm at best. Wouldn't buy it again.
2,"i don't hate this book... it's a book i would call in between.. itz just that itz not one of catherine's best.. the age between the two lovers was so huge, i was shocked.. the guy was like 16 when that girl was born... seriously.. wowee.. one advice to catherine in romance stories: never let the women be older than the men... and if the man is going to be older than the girl.. then please make not such a long period... thanks~!! i take much pleasure from reading your books~!!"
2,"I'm pretty careful with my hardware, but the dongle on this card broke off far too easily (in fact I have yet to see a dongle survive serious use). Integrated cards do not cost much more. The only reason you might want this is if you really need to be able to have something stick out of a second PCMCIA slot."
2,The one of the authers of this text teaches at UC Davis. The worked examples and questions in the book were basically taken from the work of his graduate students. This may explain the large amounts of errors found in both the examples and the problem sets. My professor has found so many errors that he no longer assigns problems that he himself has not personally checked. My professor realizes that there is nothing more frustrating than learning the methods taught in a text and not being able to reprduce the given answers. This text could also use more worked ( and corrrect ) examples of some of the more complicated problems. On the other hand it has nice pictures. (I hear the author was tranfered out of teaching electronics... I wonder if this is true)
2,"While I adore all things Poirot, this particular publication leaves much to be desired...mostly the essential images. Literally, images of clues (scribbles on paper, bits of burned documents, maps of the house) that should appear in the reading are absent. Some do not affect the storyline but others make it impossible to follow the conclusions of the characters because the reader is missing vital information. Aside from that, the pages look like simple bare internet printouts. If one cares little for aesthetics in his/her reading experience, this should not pose a problem. For others (myself included) it is a deterent to a truly enjoyable read. I suggest anyone seeking an inexpensive version of this book to choose the Barnes and Noble publication. Also inexpensive, but featuring all the bells and whistles of which Hercule Poirot himself would approve."
2,"I thought the story was okay, but it laked detail. Of course what do you expect from such a short piece."
2,"I was really looking forward to test driving these insoles, but was really disappointed. They didn't seem any more comfortable than my old ones, maybe even less so. I do an average of four miles of walking each day on a college campus and a good set of insoles would be great. But these just didn't fit the bill."
2,"I liked the ideas in the book but I found the voice so condescending I was unable to finish it. First off the author writes as if what works for her works for everyone. WHen I encountered teh following sentance I just lost interest ""They say a mexican will sit on his hauches for hours smoking a cigarette and happily looking at nothing for hours"""
2,first out i want to say that we bought it out of a clearance bin at walmart for 10 dollars the are you smarter than a 5th grader Bord game was frustrating to take out of the box we had to punch all the little deals out and unwrap somethings and then we had to figure out what every thing was and we could barely read the cards 10 dollars poorly spent i wish we bought the DVD game
2,"After having read Time's Eye..I was anticipating a deeper insight into the nature of the FirstBorn, perhaps even more information about the Eyes...a stronger Bisesa Dutt. But I was disappointed. The story was pretty much told in the first few chapters...the rest of the book just dragged us along with the details of the shield and the boring lives of the protagonists. Bisesa herself is almost a non-entity, cowering in her home for most of the book. I also expected a stronger ending and a lead up to what could have been a third book if the ending is to be believed. Still, this was readable, if only to get to the end.."
2,My baby can't be bothered with sorting the shapes to get the blocks in the box when all she has to do is remove the lid and throw the blocks in. Educational value is lacking. This toy would have been much more effective if the lid snapped on.She does really enjoy throwing the blocks in and then dumping them and starting over.
2,"The book that arrived was the correct selection but arrived somewhat damaged with a wrinkled/ folded book cover. If the packing was stronger, then the book would not have been damaged."
2,"On the package, these headphones claim a ""crystal clear"" signal up to 50 feet. I couldn't get rid of the static and intermittent popping noises when I was standing RIGHT NEXT to the base station. I changed batteries to a brand new pair, I tried switching the signals on the base station and tried several different mounting locations for the base, all to no avail. In short, these headphones were terrible. I would have given them one-star, but I must at least accept the possibility that the claim that these were ""refurbished"" was a scam just to re-sell a defective pair without actually fixing anything. This may say more about eComElectronics (who I bought these from), than about RCA, but I'll never know.Thanks for reading,-CL"
2,"As others have stated, they do arrive quickly and they are very fresh. However, the buds are reasonably small and the value is mediocre. You could stop at the local grocery and pick up the same quality roses for 9.99. I am frustrated by the overall quality of Costco roses... but who can beat two-dozen large bud roses for only 12.99.These roses also expired after about 4 days. Typically I can get a week out of delivered or grocery purchased roses.This isn't the value it seems. If you want credit for the thought and they aren't very discerning people, then go for it, otherwise save your money and call a local florist where you'll still get the best expensive bang for your buck."
2,"The distance between the pour spout and base is very small. Unable to get a cereal bowl under easily, we use saucer and fill our bowl from that.."
2,The outside is unbreakable but not the plunger. I never dropped it or put it in the dishwasher. This thing didn't even last a year. I went to wash it the other day and the plastic around the screen just fell apart into a bunch of pieces. Who cares if the outside works if your coffee is full of grounds?
2,"Are you kidding me? I have lived in Wallabees most of my life. I wore them back in 1970 up until 2000. Why on God's green Earth is the most minimalistic shoe $100.00? Especially, when it is made in China? I loved Wallabees, I don't know who Clark is, but they are bending you all forwards to pay that much money for a bare bones shoe. I'll stick to any shoe that I can find that is American. Sad state of affairs. I recently bought Caterpillar and Wolverines. Both were solely American, now parts of both shoes are part American and yet mostly from other countries. Even K-Swiss went down to communist labor. I am truly sickened by Clark going with a one-hundred plus price tag on a shoe that was adored by hippies for just being minimalistic foot-wear. Shame on you Clarks and I am truly sorry for those who just went with the flow. I am giving it a 2 because I like the shoe, but WAY TOO OVER-PRICED!!!"
2,"Robin Williams is a comedian who is running for President of the United States. As usual, Williams plays his part well, but unfortunately he is in a movie with a severe identity crisis. The movie starts out as a comedy, but suddenly it turns more serious when computer fraud is discovered by a beautiful young woman (Laura Linney) who feels duty-bound to report this to Williams. If the movie had stuck to one genre, such as comedy, satire, or drama it would have been much better, but instead it tries to mix the three with less than satisfactory results. Robin Williams is capable of brilliance when he is in a good movie, but unfortunately this is not a very good movie."
2,"This book was recommended to me, and I was excited to read it, because I thought the premise was fascinating. However, the book quickly became disappointing. The characters were not well-developed, and by the end they felt like one-dimensional clichés. I did not understand why Norah and Paul were so unhappy throughout the entire book. They never knew David's secrete until after he passed away. The character voices did not ring true to me."
2,"I loved the movie and watched it about 10 times. I brought the soundtrack and I was disappointed that they didn't have some of my favorite songs that were in the movie. There are some good songs on the soundtrack but can't they make another CD? I mean where are the other good songs. The only songs that I liked were Graduate, Can't Get Enough of You Baby, and Paradise City. The other songs are lame. I just wish that they would make a CD called More Can't Hardly Wait and it would be nice if they did. Don't waste your money!"
2,"As an Eileen Dreyer fan, I was sadly disappointed with this book. The rapid, choppy, hospital slang was hard to read. Timmie was not a very sympathetic character, and the other characters were so alike I had a hard time keeping straight who was who."
2,"Lovely leather in a comfortable case. Too bad the clip design is so bad. My original lasted 3 weeks. I bought a replacement and it lasted just 2 (and the clip broke in 2 different places!). Now I carry the case around in my pocket.If anyone has a suggestion for a holster that actually works (and puts the Blackberry to sleep), I'd love to hear it."
2,"Like the title says, I couldn't get it to work for my old computer which ran Windows 98. But it works great for Vista."
2,"I have to say that I found the whole Rama series to be a bit disappointing. I expected a series with the quality of Clarke's ""Odyssey"" Novels, but they just didn't live up to expectation. There was too many sub-plots and mysteries left un-resolved, events that were over emphasized but never clarified. And to be honest, I found many aspects of the book to be totally unrealistic. Overall this series was quiet a let down. If your going to buy this book, buy if used!"
2,"Very disappointed in the Bissell 3108 EasyVac Powerbrush. I purchased the product to clean my bare floors which are saltillo tile, ceramic, and brick. It would only pick up the smallest pieces of sand and some of the cat litter. Just did not have enough power to pick up much of anything. Bissell should not call this a POWER brush. It has no suction power."
2,"This is my second Propad Gamepad, and it will be my last. Anytime I want to use it, I have to calibrate it every time. That's a nuisance, but not the only problem. If I don't calibrate it, and want to play a computer game that can be played with either keyboards or gamepads, the game always gets screwed up. One of the buttons doesn't do anything at all (and, according to my game, Fifa 99, the button should pass the soccer ball), and two others are switched. The only thing that works properly is the D-Pad. Basically, this is a piece of crap. I can use it, but only when I have to (for playing 2 player games.) The price is really cheap- and you get what you pay for. A really cheap, piece of crap."
2,"This movie really falls flat compared to the original. Angus Sutherland makes for a very dull and unconvincing leader of the vampires. He and Autum Reeser have very little on-screen chemistry, yet we are to believe that she falls for him. The plot is incredibly predictable and unoriginal. The film fails to make you care about any of the characters. The production values are good, and the acting is decent, but the story is not at all engaging. In short, there is a good reason this one went straight to video - it's completely lackluster. Do yourself a favor and pass on this film..."
2,"I came into my reading of the THE FUTURIST expecting witty, biting satire, and an overall intelligent send-up of contemporary American Culture, politics, terrorism, media, and everything in between. What I got was a mildly interesting book that was short on wit and any original insight, full of clunky prose, repetitive scenes, a HEAVILY contrived plot, and overall, not very funny. Additionally, the book is already quite lean at 229 pages, and it still felt about sixty pages too long. It reads like a novella, or even a short story, that some editor advised the author to pad to attain novel length. I am a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut, George Saunders, George Orwell, Haruki Murakami, and all the great satirists of our time. This book is a pretender to the throne. Be forwarned."
2,"Macy is clearly a talented writer, but I couldn't for the life of me understand the motivations of most of the characters. The character of Kate is completely unappealing, and I couldn't understand why men were drawn to her. I would have been much more interested if we could have gotten into her head. I grew up around people like this, and I still couldn't muster up any interest in the characters. A big disappointment."
2,"Ella Minnow Pea has a clever title, and in fact is very creatively written. I am sure it took hours of concentration to get everything right. And if you are interested in word play and word games, this is the book for you. The characters and the plot are just incidental. It could be a great allegory about Nazi Germany, but if it is, I missed it. If you are looking for a message or character development, this isn't the place."
2,"I really liked my black Avante toaster while it was alive, but it only lasted for 9 months and now refuses to toast anything."
2,"The book was written probably some 15 years ago, when Real Options barely existed and the only tools available to consultants were efficient frontier and NPV. The treatment of risk vs. return is very simplistic, NPV concept does not hold any more (ROV is a way to go). In summary: an outdated book."
2,"I used this book for a introductory course to graduate students that had no programming experience. This book was not set up for introductory students. You really need to have expericence with programming languages, especially C and Pascal to make heads or tails of this book.I didn't like the layout...spending the first part of the book telling you what it is going to talk about, and then spending the second part retelling you. In some cases, in exactly the same words....the organization needs some work and the index and glossary were not thorough enough to be of help. I ended up buying two other books on programming languages to help explain this one to me so I could finish the course.The review questions did nothing to prepare you for the problem sets at the end of each chapter and the problem sets didn't really have examples in the text that you could refer back to. Like I said, it seemed that the book expected you to know more than introductory level."
2,"After reading rave reviews of this book, I was very disappointed. (Especially that I bought it in hardcover!!!) It reads like an article out of ""Seventeen"" magazine. Who cares how many cigarettes she smoked and how much weight she lost or gained....or lost....or gained....??? It was funny in the beginning, but tedious as it went on....and on...and on. If this book can get published than I should send my journals to Viking and make a million bucks. My life is far more interesting. On the plus side...there are some funny bits and the prose flows nicely. I wasn't bored reading it, but I can't say I was disappointed when I finished it."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but it seems to have been put together in a hurry. Mr. Jeffers facts were not checked. I don't know if I should blame the author or the editor. pg 305 - 309, Washington Roebling the NEPHEW of the Brooklyn Bridge builder died on the Titanic, not the bridge builder who lived until 1926.Brady is NOT entombed in Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn, he is in the ground in Holy Cross cemetery in Brookyn. pg 319My head hurt from the mistakes! THey are throughout the book. I hope Mr. Jeffers is more on top of his other works - this one was painfull."
2,"What was the point of this book? Reading about Keith Flemming's life is like reading about your next door neighbor, Bob. Who cares? He sprinkles in some interesting stories about his life and learnings with Uncle Ed.. but the rest is trivial and boring."
2,Fortunatly this soundtrack does not really feature Brian Mays smothered and usually weak vocals but the composings mostly nothing special and dialogue from the film ruins Brian Mays first attempt at a soundtrack as well.
2,"As a former elementary school teacher, I ordered the book to perhaps give me more insight to my grandchildrens' art work. I found nothing new or insightful AND with research on the net found it valueless.It was a $35 waste."
2,"Don't get me wrong, this camera takes great pictures. Very good quality even at the lowest setting. As everyone has said, the LCD is useless in low light, as well as the zoom function is akward unless you have rather small hands. BUT, here's the kicker, I have had the camera since Christmas, and today, I get ZOOM ERROR when zooming in to take a pic. I stop, and look at the camera and the lens seems to be crooked. So I tunr the camera off and when the lens is trying to retract it POPS OFF. I took it to Wolf Camera and they said it will have to be sent to Fuji....I would NOT reccomend this camera if you don't have time and money to hassle with repairs if the camera breaks."
2,"I'm confused as to why the author puts so much emphasis on the sleep paralysis episodes. It's a perfectly normal condition, and she claims to be aware of this fact, but she still goes on to attribute it to paranormal acitivty. She implies that the episodes got worse due to the haunting, including a smothering sensation, a sense of an evil presence, and a sense of overwhelming terror, but these are still CLASSIC symptoms of sleep parlaysis. From Scientific American: ""The reason sleep paralysis may explain tales of ghosts and aliens is the strong sense of a presence, usually harmful, that victims commonly feel during an attack.""Also, people tend to experience sleep paralysis episodes more frequently due to stress, so all it demonstrates is that the author was stressed out during this time, not that it was actually caused by ghosts (as she would like her readers to believe)."
2,"Bought this Texsport Padre Island Hammock stand for my in laws for Christmas. They were delightful to receive it as my mother in law has been wanting a hammock for a while. I chose this because of the size stated it's 136 inch long which would make a good match for a hammock we also bought for them.To our disappointment, the description was misleading. The size is indeed 136 inch long but what the description didn't tell me is that it will only FIT UP TO 120 inch hammock! The hammock we bought ended up too long and when you're on it, your behind will touch the floor.My father in law informed me that when they assembled this stand, some parts didn't match perfectly. Either too loose or too tight that he'd have to rig it to make it fit if they were to keep this hammock stand.Amazon was great at giving me a full refund though.Texsport, please update the description! I uploaded a picture so other customers wouldn't be fooled like I did."
2,"I got this for X-mas plugged it in and the sound was great then I attached my ipod and the volume stopped working, I disconnected it and then unpluged the system. Now when I plug it in it emits a high pitched sqeaking and will not turn on."
2,"I would place this in the you get what you pay for Category. There is a reason why HDMI cables are expensive, eventually the price will come down but $3 for a cable is too good to be true. I bought Sony HDMI cables they were $40 for a 6ft cable. worked fine on my PS3 I tried this one. It would not even work. I bought 3 of these and one of them worked, out the package then it died, so none work, sticking with the $40 cables. If you spent $1k+ on a TV and blu-ray or PS3 spend the extra $$$ and get quality cables."
2,"I was expecting something more scholarly I suppose. The Gourmet Atlas contains: some great maps of the migration of foodstuffs; recipes which look good; time-lines; charts and some wonderful photos and pretty pictures. But this visual appeal is at the expense of the text, which I found light-weight, and the writing is sometimes confusing. If you are serious about food then this is lacking in many areas - no bibliography or references for starters and I found some factual errors. The very short introduction promises that the atlas will be THE source for the avid student and casual inquirer. The serious student would be better to stick to something like Waverley Root's FOOD.Meanwhile I await Alan Davidson's The Oxford Companion to Food. The Gourmet Atlas is a pretty book and could prove quite handy butis hardly a definitive reference. Good for someone starting out with an interest in food."
2,"Most of the remixes today are very short, like the old times, most of them are around the 5-6 minutes. With that in mind, I don't understand, why do they have to edit what it is already short? and even more mix it. The mix is nothing really special and the tracks selected are not necessarily the hottest hits, with the exception of THE SOUND OF SAN FRANCISCO by GLOBAL DEEJAYS, and STAR TO FALL by CABIN CREW. There are some other 5 good tracks but that's it!!! Then the ones mentioned are 12 inch versions edited to make them shorter to include more tracks that tell you nothing. They could have released the full 12 inch versions of 20 of the total tracks and there would still have empty space. The 2 stars are for the price and the 7 good songs (NOT FILLERS!!!!). Everywhere, Shine, Greece 2000, Flashdance, and Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"
2,"I've had one of these for years, which proves they can last a long time. It heats water very fast and has a huge opening, so you can't spill stuff you pour into it. The downside is that there is no on-off switch. The result is that you have to unplug it to turn it off and plug it in to turn it on! I ended up installing an in-line switch on the cord, which works fine, but which took some effort and a few bucks to do. There are other equally good hot pots with built-in on-off switches. I recommend getting one of those."
2,"Next time I'll buy a Brother brand toner cartridge. The first compatable cartridge they sent me malfunctioned after a few days. The low toner warning appeared, I couldn't assume that the cartridge was was full and the warning signal was the problem. Bright light Business was willing to replace the unit, I ahd to pay postage (one way) and they were slow getting my repalacement to me."
2,"Hurricane Stainless Steel Manual Wheatgrass Juicer- Hand Crank Juice Extractor for Wheat Grass & Barley Grass JuicingWe were really excited when we first got this product. However, after about a week it just didn't seem to work right, if it ever did. Out of an entire tray of wheatgrass i get about a half a shot, it should be about, from what i've read, two shots a tray. Its not. The machine is incredibly inefficient, and i wish i hadn't purchased it."
2,"I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon. It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections. the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud."
2,"When nurse Larcy Ryan takes a job as caregiver to cancer and heart patient David Magnam, she has no idea what web of secrets and lies she's inserting herself into. Everything is oh so mysterious, and there's even talk of.... murder (I swear, the author actually writes ""....murder"" and she isn't even being funny).As time passes, Larcy learns more and more things that leave her fearful and suspicious. That brooding house, it broods, broodily. Larcy lives in a state of panic and trepidation, which worsens with every new incident that occurs. The puzzle pieces begin to form a picture, a climax is reached (and I'm not talking sex-- by the way, there's no sex in this book, if that makes any difference to you), everyone takes their bows, The End.We're all familiar with these types of storylines, I'm sure, and you'll find nothing revelatory or unique here. It's an okay way to pass a few hours, but that's about all it is."
2,"A disappointing, predictable and (again) unsophisticated and almost juvenille product from Ms. Divakaruni. Negative in its tone. Self-concious and self-important in style. As in her ""Mistress.."", Divakaruni constantly throws out these ""exotic"" Indian terms, etc., as if to ""wow"" the gullible, pedestrian masses (her ""readership""). She should start including a glossary in her books. And again, as in ""Mistress..."", all protagonists as it were, seem to be longing for a tall, ""romantic"", (caucasian) Euro-male. What I've always sensed from Ms. Divakaruni is an undercurrent of white-male-lust and longing - and an odd self-loathing. She had better stop being ""cute"" and embrace herself for what she is. There is also something stilted and dishonest in her work."
2,"I read the first page of this book and decided that I would enjoy it. Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. The first page was the only good page. Book sucked. I don't know what book the other reviewers were reading.Sorry...Try again"
2,The clear faceplate curves in front of the numbers so that it almost guarantees that there will be reflections in the way (at least in alighted room). So I bought the Westclox Echo to replace it.
2,"I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying ""But McBride's Books Say"". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind."
2,"1.The whole book could have been written in 20-30 pages. Really!2. Now if you dont know anything about OOP, I think books that to explain concepts through ballons which have properties (red/blue/plastic) states(IsBlown) methods(BallonFly,BallonMakeNoise) events(OnBallonNail,OnBallonTouch) and other ""abstract"" manners DO HARM the reader. The beginner is left with a big ?, bigger than if he wouldn't red anything about OOP.3. On the other hand if you know OOP the hard way, by experience through languages, this book HAS NOTHING TO OFFER, except maybe one ot two refreshing concepts."
2,"The gel in these pads are fine, but like all knee pads the problem is the constant adjustments needed to keep them in place. They also came bent on one side. The straps are not held in place well partly because the clips don't grab onto them and hold."
2,Bad picture quality . Colors not vivid . This is a DVD created from 1970's and found to be so boring I just shut off . Not one of the better ones on Amazon .
2,"Please take my advice and get the Lonely Planet or other language guide for Turkish. As a traveler who is not learning the full language, or even sentence structure, during a shortish trip, this book won't be helpful. If you're learning Turkish for real, this might be good as it's organized Turkish-->English and English-->Turkish like a dictionary. However, I just wanted to look up phrases for situations: i.e. when purchasing a train ticket; at the restaurant; at the market; and this guide is horrible for that."
2,"If you have a high efficiency (HE) washing machine, this product is not for you. I didn't realize there was a non-he detergent available, as it is not listed on the seventh generation website. Will have to return."
2,"This book is mostly a series of gee wiz ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" type vignettes. There are threads of good information that might have made an interesting short article with some major editing."
2,"It never ceases to amaze me how people who get upset about white-on-black racism think it's perfectly OK when the roles are reversed. They're either being ignorant or incredibly patronizing to blacks.Chappelle is certainly capable of raising a grin when a skit clicks, but the show relies too much on the kind of crudeness that suggests a target audience of middle-school-age boys. And when you add in his obvious dislike of white people, it's just not worth the effort... at least if you're white yourself."
2,not what I was looking for. product no better than cheapos that come with cheap mp3 players
2,"I should've known that there would be trouble when I nearly ran into the wall trying to do the ""Axl Rose"" move. But after watching Amy Bento's latest dvd, ""All Cardio-Hi-Lo Knockout"" a few more times, I finally gave up and called it a day. This dvd was just too confusing for me. While I did work up a sweat, I was too frustruated after surviving all of the complex choreography to appreciate it. Heck, I was trying so hard to keep up with Bento and company's movements that I barely noticed the allegedly good background music mentioned by so many other reviewers! I recommend this dvd only to those with lots of time, patience, and living room space."
2,"This device works ""OK"". Jet stream is moderate. Noise is considerable. Has a lot of attachments that really don't do much. I'm not sure what the brushes even do. The dual tank function is pretty good. But lack of pressure and too much noise outweigh the good part."
2,"The original card shuffler I bought years ago worked so much better. In fact, if I had the time, I would return this one. I am very disappointed in my purchase. I just wish it were easier to return merchandise bought on Amazon.com"
2,"Not really functional. My son doesn't pee too often while changing, so I lucked out. He does pee every time I bathe him, but we are already in the tub, so I don't worry about this. These are more fun than functional."
2,"While the author provides us with some interesting new information about this action, it is presented like a sports announcer's play by play. If you like sound bites, you will love this book. Some might appreciate the frequent use of naval slang; but the constant reference to the graduation class of every naval officer mentioned, no matter how briefly, is annoying and distracting."
2,".The performances here are not without emotion. There's a tight, nervous intensity in the Schubert (though balmy and itchy in comparison to Carl Schuricht's metaphysical pyrotechnics!).The Beethoven, though, is bloated and flat and this is one score which needs a lean, athletic approach and one where I'd thought Toscanini would have excelled. Unfortunately the music never quite gets off the ground."
2,"This deck, though very beautiful... well... thats all it is. This deck is great for the people who just think of Tarot as ""A fun game"" For those of you who are expirenced tarot readers or are in it for the spirituality of it, then definitly do NOT buy this deck."
2,"This was a decent book for what it is.It is NOT a book for someone who likes to read and learn more than you can get from watching the History Channel.While a few scattered photos and maps can make a book interesting, this was a book of pictures with very little text, lacking anything you probably don't know already.There are a number of really good bucks about WWII, and this is not one of them. At least not in my opinion."
2,"SBL sounds like a very much calculated and formulaic slick studio production. The guys aim high but unfortunately they don't have the substance that is necessary to make it happen. Although each track on this album is individually fun to listen to, when you listen to the entire album you can't help but think of other bands who had been in these waters before.It is almost impossible to talk about a band identity so the album very quickly becomes boring after a few spins. I'm not sure how far anybody can go by simply creating hollow stylish tunes. To me they sound like they're gonna jump on to the next trend train and have a drastic sound shift in their second effort. After all music business is all about making cash !"
2,"I was a little disappointed with this soap. It had a very artificial, perfumy, floral smell, rather than a rich sandalwood smell I would expect from Sandalwood soap. I'm not sure if this is by design and it's just a matter of taste, or if this is just a cheaper sandalwood soap, because I don't have a ton of experience with different brands."
2,This book didn't provide any surprises. I knew who the killer was as soon as he was introduced. The identity of the goat boy was no surprise. The little insightful talks with dad were artificially introduced and the interracial relationship seemed artifical as well. I also expected a lot more atmospheric feel to the story.
2,"I have read many books by the ""MASTER"". My favourite author by far. Never mind the outdated science or the religious parallels, the story is just plain bad. Characters in power too easily manipulated for one thing. The Galaxy is in potential peril and the Procurator figures he would wait it out and see if it's true instead of investigating. The denouement felt like he had to finish the story because he had a train to catch.That's enough of me complaining on the MASTER's work.How can anyone give this story 5 stars is beyond me."
2,"I have had a couple different water filters, and I had to find one that was self-contained and wouldn't break off (to suit my husband, who kept breaking them). After using this filter for about a month, my hair and skin are drier than ever, hair is unmanageable, and zits are popping up on my face again. I'm on the lookout for a different one immediately."
2,"I have two boys, 7 and 2, both thumb-suckers. At first I thought this was a miracle product, until they got used to the taste and just went back to sucking their thumbs. My 7-year-old only sucks his thumb at night, and I tried putting it on after he'd fallen asleep, but he sucked his thumb anyway. My 2-year-old wants to suck his thumb constantly. I will apply it and it works as a deterrent for about an hour, then he just sucks his thumb anyway, so I end up having to reapply it and the cycle begins all over again. I guess I just have very stubborn children, because this stuff tastes so horrible and lingers forever in your mouth!"
2,"I waited for this headset with anticipation and was sorely let down!! I don't know who's ear's this was designed for but i do know they are not human. I have played with this thing so many different ways and it never fits, falls off all the time and looks plain stupid on!!Also, the volume is so quiet that it is unuseable whilst driving (the whole reason i and many others want a bluetooth)!!The only redeeming feature is the battery life. You can use it a for a week and not have to recharge it.My recomendation....look elsewere!!"
2,"The problem with this book is that it dwells on the obvious and does NOT have chapters on 2 very notable examples of presidential courage: 1) Gerald Ford's pardoning of Nixon and 2) Chester Alan Arthur, who did a 180 in passing civil service reform legislation and turned on the spoils system of which he was a product."
2,"At times interesting, at times dull. I was fine with that until I came to page 235 to read about Scotts in the American South. Herman says the term ""redneck"" was a Scots border term meaning Presbyerterians and ""cracker"" was also a Scottish term. That was news to me. I've checked with several sources and have never been able to find any indication this was true.Things like that, and the absence of footnotes, leads me to feel uneasy about the accuracy of this book.I shared some of the book with my church's business administrator, a native of Scotland. His response was to laugh and ask, ""Who is this man?""I suspect Herman is American. It shows when he refers to the Church of England as Episcopal -- which is technically true, but non-americans would have referred to the Church of England as Anglican. A telling moment that also made me wonder about the biases Herman may have brought in to the writing.All in all, I just felt uneasy about trusting the author and his sources."
2,Haven't really been able to go through this book. It doesn't hold my attention too well. Wouldn't really recommend it.
2,"With Denis Leary and Steve Buscemi in this movie you would think this would be a non-stop laugh riot right? WRONG!. If you like jay leno/Johnny Carson kinda' jokes, then maybe. I thought this movie was very disorganize, very mild in humor, more of a drama/love story, and had about the same enjoyment as stepping on your kids toys in the middle of the night. Denis, please go back to stand up! (I love his ""no cure for cancer""!!!!!!)"
2,"Pringles Jalapeno Potato Crisps just don't cut it. Not good on my breath either. Honestly, they don't taste that good."
2,"It is inconceivable to me how companies like Archos could have it all and consistently sabotage themselves. What is missing on the market is a simple-to-use, high-capacity player (40GB and up) for playing and recording multiple music formats, and data backup, not two similarly deficient products from the same company in different form factors with ""downloadable plug-ins"". The later idea is cheap captialism and razorblade marketing and simply moronic. If the player has all these capabilities, why not sell it all-in-the-box ready to go? I bought a different player/recorder and I am convinced that Archos looses a lot of customers due to such pathetic marketing (and a website that looks like from the beginnings of the web.)"
2,"This game seems like it would be really cool from the two hours I spent playing it.. it reminded me a lot of my many many hours spent playing Everquest back in the day. Unfortunately, it really does remind me of Everquest from back in the day. Graphics engine has not been updated, and at the same cost as the main competitors, why am I looking further?I'd love to see a game with a great story, or gameplay value, or some other gimmick make it big.. but at least have the current graphics engine, or offer a discount on the monthly rate.The CD1 came unable to read; I have high speed internet, not a big deal.. but hopefully that's not a common occurrence."
2,"What is this new trend that Warner Brothers is doing with their Hanna Barbera product? We already know that the DVD sets are a success.This episode is from the 1980's revival of the show, so the episode is not in the Season One box set. These later episodes were produced shorter (22 minutes) with new end titles and an updated theme song in the opening. This is the original syndication presentation of the 1980s series."
2,"I was expecting from the name of this product for it to go on blue. It doesn't. I was very disappointed and hope that in the future, the company will make it more clear what to expect from the lipstick."
2,"It turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife's ears. I assume that the stems must not be white gold? Other than that they are as expected. Not perfect, but not bad for the price."
2,"I ignored all the negative reviews that stated the vacuum overheated and stopped working. I shouldn't have. After about a year, I can barely get 1 room done before it overheats. I have to then leave it off for a good hour before attempting another room. When it's running, it works great. But there is no way it should overheat like that so quickly."
2,"This was one of my least favorite Sparks books so far. Although touching in many ways, I thought it lacked a certain spark (so to speak)."
2,"This is NO $30 flashlight. Cheap on/off switch either doesn't change the brightness or turns it off when you want it brighter. AA batteries are stored in the legs with very flimsy screw feet to hold them in. If you twisted too hard it would probably strip the plastic threads. Adjustable aiming beam has light detent stops.Overall, I would not buy this item again. It says ""heavy-duty"" but I don't give it a year. Definitely not a professional grade tool."
2,"""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"" are the only 2 good songs on here, and even those two are way too overplayed and get old VERY fast. The other songs are just lame, middle-of-the-road junk. The song ""Naughty Girl"" does not really have vocals at all, more like whines. Songs like ""Hip Hop Star"" and ""That's how you like it"" are full of rappers making noises in the background. Most of the ballads are great songs if you are looking for the perfect song to fall asleep to. And most of the pop/R &B stuff like ""Be With you,"" ""Me, Myself and I"" and ""Yes"" are somewhat catchy but can't compare to the likes of Mariah Carey or Aaliyah. ""Dangerously in Love"" sounds no different than the song of the same title on the Destiny's Child ""Survivor"" album. And the last song ""Daddy"" is a little eeky. Listen to it and you'll know what I mean. I really hope she goes back to Destiny's Child."
2,"I bought this flashlight as a replacement for my other broken one. I bought it mainly because of its small size and price. I would have loved it if it worked, but the first time I took it out of it's packaging it wouldn't even turn on. I opened it up and looked at it but everything looked fine. I twisted the cap back on and gave it a light tap and it turned on.I figured it was good to go and let it sit. A couple weeks later I came back to it and tried to turn it on again. Well needless to say it didn't, even after trying anything I could think of to turn it on. It's a nice looking product, but one that I won't be buying in the future."
2,"This is super soft, but ran small. I'm a 12/14 and it fits too snugly to wear on it's own. Very cute though. Just buy up a size."
2,"I really wanted to give this one star, but that's not really fair to the board, which works fine. The videowave software is extremely limited and doesn't even allow you do do much of what is in the manual. For instance, there are modules to allow adjustment of color and brightness, but they are disabled. So all you can do is look at them. Customer service requires an ID number which is not provided with this version. So the only way you can get help is to pay for phone support. I'm so turned off by this I will likely avoid all Roxio software in the future.Bottom line, buy the board if that is what you want, but don't even think about using the software."
2,"Both of my 8 wk old shih tzu's can climb out of this. It's a very cute play pen but design wise it lacks. I think the horizontal bars are too close together for puppies to use as a ladder and climb out of it.Instead of using it as a playpen, I'll use 2 pieces to block the doorway or part of a room when needed and that works great!"
2,I purchased this fan and it was amazing for about four weeks. After that the oscillating motor went out. I exchanged the fan for a new one and again the oscillting motor went out after about four weeks. After that I switched to a Lasko fan and it has been running strong for eight months.
2,"I have purchased Taxcut Deluxe and Taxcut State and applied for the rebate for the State program $19.99) as advertised. I sent TaxCut all the required information, de codes, the sales receipt and some form I had to fill out.After 6 weeks I received it back in the original envelope with a letter from TaxCut stating that I had not sent them the sales receipt and codes. They only sent me back the form. They are obviously lying and they won't give me my refund. I suspect the whole rebate thing is a scam and consumer's fraud.No more Taxcut for me. The program is not that great anyway."
2,"I was suspicious when reading the previous reviews about these re-manufactured printer cartridges, but thought to my self, ""what can i loose?"" I found that the cartridge emptied just when I needed to print something in color for my kid to go to school the next day. The two lessons to be learned here, if you leave your homework assignment till Sunday night, a small hiccup can be a big problem. The second is, you get what you pay for; and these cheapies will not be in my shopping cart ever again."
2,"I have been playing delta force since the first one, and it seems with every new game nova logic comes out with they get worst. they can't get any worst then black hawk down.If all you want to do is play it offline then your ok, but if your like me and you like the online play, forget it, ... you no sooner get online with it then your back on desktop trying to get it going again, tech support says they will one day get a fix for it, since so many people are having a problem with it, but even on a good day when it don't restart itself right away, it still gives you other problems that make it sooooo not worth playing."
2,"The first few episodes are pretty good, but the show gets really repetitive quickly. My husband and I were watching and we just got bored after a while. We just kinda looked at each other and were like, ""Meh, let's watch something else.""I still can't figure out if we're supposed to like Casey or not. And the sorority girls get really annoying. I guess there is a certain audience for this, which is not me. If you are a girl that's into clothes, money/status, makeup, and being boy crazy, this show is for you. If you're a guy that's into girls and parties, and don't really think about much else, this show is probably for you as well."
2,"The songs are great, I've already heard some. However, the dual disc format won't allow me to upload the songs to iTunes. Now I'll probably have to buy it on iTunes if I want to listen to it on my computer."
2,"this book was really a ho humm. It was very repetitive over and over with the main character blacking out, and eating voraciously...the ending was just blah..glad this was a swap and not a full out purchase..pass this one up.."
2,"The album was the bomb. Because he was one of the best Dj in Chicago.He will all way be in our heart ever seen the day I meet him.I will like for this album to seel alot of copy.He will always bethe best DJ in Chicago and will be in our mind forever.Thank You,MiguelP.S Go out there and get tha album u will like it."
2,"This paint by number is one of the most annoying that I've bought. It requires color mixing (which a lot of paint by numbers do), but it is not intuitive at all. The numbers on the ""canvas"" are in a handwritten type font, and are almost impossible to read. There's no guide like most paint by numbers have, just a reproduction of the ""canvas"" on the packaging. The paint pots are difficult to open, and don't appear to have much product in them. There are some spots on the canvas that are just completely blank, with no way to tell what color they should be. In the smaller spaces an arrow is used to indicate color, but if you paint the larger areas first (as recommended) you'll cover them up. And lastly, in order to achieve the look on the packaging, you'd need to do a lot of painting even after filling in every space. I'm not a fan of this paint by number at all."
2,"First if all this book has so many charachters with not so interesting lives that even after reading 300 of the about 700 pages I still was not drawn to continue. This was a book that 8 fellow friends tried to read and we all felt similar, one or two of us even shot to the end to see if there was anything groundbreaking that would make us want to continue. Sadly not. Of the 6 books we have read together so far this was the only stinker."
2,After a few months the outdoor temp stopped working. Replaced batteries in remote sensor (followed directions exactly). No luck. Disappointed. Time and indoor temp works fine.
2,"I am disappointed with this book...I didn't think that it was another ""block"" book.. too bad..."
2,Not real easy for the kids to learn to animated and not interesting for them. Not happy for the price it cost.
2,"""Cinnammon Roses"" is by far the standout in this thin little book and is one of the few stories that is actually erotic and interesting. The majority of the stories here are, unfortunately written with a heavy handed, unsexy style of clinical sex that is anything but what I'd term ""erotic"". Juvenile descriptions of faceless body parts entering other faceless body parts does not equal erotica. There was little story and even less characterization here and the ""vampire"" tales were mostly rehashes that have been done far better by other authors. My recommendation is to skip this one, save yourself a few bucks and if you're looking few a few chills and thrills pick up a Hot Blood anthology (edited by Jeff Gelb) instead."
2,"To quote James ""if i hadn't seen such riches, I could live with being poor""thats problem for the Second Coming, the first record was a majestic moment in time, a time capsule of joy and ecstacy,This record is the day after, although a good record in its own right, its not great.Heavy, laboured and leaden it's more like a come down than the second coming.I would suggest skipping this and moving straight on to Ian Browns solo work."
2,"There is a reason these speakers cost so little. The sound quality is horrible. The amount of static that comes out of these speakers is inexcusable. The issue is not an isolated one either. The company I work with ordered these in bulk and the static is the rule...lack of static is the exception. Buyer beware, the low price of the speakers should give you an idea of their quality. The Blue LED power light is indeed nice looking as others have stated."
2,"This book read like a bunch of newspaper clippings from a variety of papers published at that time. The author puts forward several theories of who killed Mary Rogers, but they all have holes in them. Best part of the book was about Poe's womanizing and alcoholism."
2,"This game is awesome when you choose your Pokemon at the beginning but it gets boring later. It's cool fighting the trainers, but you can only fight them once (except for the Elite Four.) This game starts off as a best-seller, and drops down to an instant 0 in seconds!"
2,Worked fine for a while but didn't crush can as much as I'd like.The bottom piece started to deform and bend down. Then the cans would pop out as you tried to crush them.I tried to reinforce it with a block of wood and even with some metal L brackets. Didn't hold.I've given up and step on them on the concrete floor with better luck.Wish there were a decent crusher at less than $10!
2,"Alan Dean Foster can be an exasperating writer. Sometimes his books are among the best but sometimes he just bores me. This is not one of his better efforts.One would be better served by reading any Flinx novel or alomost any fantasy by him. I always thought his best was ""Into the Dark"" But that's just me. . .you have to find your own.That said this is an exploration of the ""alien capture turns person into a specimen"" and it evolves from that premise. With Alan Dean Foster's usual twists on that: a talking rational dog. Much more rational, and funny than the protagonist who comes off kind of an idiot sometimes actually. Etc. It all seemed very familiar to me somehow. I slogged to a halt about three quarters through so at least I won't give away the ending. I never got there. I'm sure there will be something from him that fires up in the future. This ain't it."
2,"I loved this book when I started reading it. I love the strong female character, the time setting and her family. It made for a very interesting story. But then it all fell apart. She became a sappy female, learning of family and friends secrets page after page after page after page. While the author sets the stage for more books, I don't think I will buy it."
2,This isn't such a great video. The parts of the wicked witch and the violence and the no-color can make children that are 4 or younger scared and make them want color.
2,"Band is really skinny, box that ring was shipped in had a small bag that ring was tucked into liner almost didn't relize something was in pouch. Stones are to large for band they sit on"
2,"I got these on sale recently - and I guess you get what you pay for. My girlfriend put one in the dishwasher (don't know if they are dishwasher safe or not) and it basically fell apart - got a huge crack down the middle. The smaller one actually broke. These don't seem to be made of one piece of wood, but three pieces glued together. avoid."
2,"It was difficult to tell as the dvd's were not secure, or were jostled somehow, out of the disc holder in package. The discs were shaking in unopened package. There were some scratches from the discs moving against one another and many scenes were difficult to see or hear.I think this might have been a good collection, but too difficult to watch.Sorry."
2,"I wasn't so impressed with this Firm workout. I found it went really fast whereas the newer Firm videos are a little bit slower (but still a good workout) and show you how to do the exercises correctly. Also, I just didn't like the background... there were a ton of people doing the exercise with the instructor, unlike the newer videos, and I found that distracting."
2,I havent used this progam a lot but from my experience so far it is not impressive in the least bit... I tried to create a dvd from home video and for some reason it will not burn it to dvd...The programs have a lot of whistles and bells but if you cant burn your project to dvd or cd it really doesnt do any good unless you just want to store it on your computer. Considering this software is for cd and dvd burning that is what one person would expect it to do.. No bang for your buck here it is a good thing that it didnt cost much!!!
2,"Well I don't have it, but a couple friends bought piranhas over a year ago. I'd rather have the Gravis GamePad Pro, which has 8 buttons for 8 different functions. Besides, serial-like connection is kinda out of date."
2,"Dear Flagship Studios,When I buy a game, it is because I want to be able to install it and play it. This seems simple but you must have forgotten because what I've done instead is install it and spend 5 hours trying to figure out why it doesn't work even though my system exceeds minimum requirements.A game should function out of the box. Period. I am in Iraq, so downloading a slew of fix-it patches on a super slow military network is not going to happen. This has proven to be an immensely frustrating experience for me as I was very much looking forward to this game. Next time do a bit more Quality Assurance, mmmkay?"
2,"I got these to try because some reported that they are much much different from regular walnuts. I normally eat the 'premium walnut halves' from Trader Joe's (in the US). I found that these were not much different in flavor, or indeed not as good in flavor. They were broken pieces with a lot of bitter dark skin on them and twice as expensive as the Trader Joe's walnuts. I would not recommend these to anyone over the Trader Joe's walnuts."
2,"Can't believe Amazon itself selling used item marked as NEW. First of all, the little packaging was just simply taped at one end. Second, when I opened it, can see some dirts in it with too much lubricant oil."
2,"Hmmm. Nu-metal with better vocals. Well you can pour chocolate syrup over cow manure but how much better does it really taste? It's on par with a Creed album. To comapre it with Tori Amos is just silly. I keep hearing this hailed as some sort of ""gothic rock"" too. Huh? EvanEssence isn't awful, but they're nothing to get excited over."
2,"Color and look was alright, but I had to return it since it was tight for the camera."
2,"Probably a perfectly good product but I did not realize that I would have to have a hole drilled through my house wall to utilize it.I am a somewhat disabled senior and waited for my son's advice & help. He did not want to drill the hole through a very thick wall. It was then just too late to return the item, hence it will probably get donated to charity."
2,disappointed that these rings (bought two) turn black while ON the hand. My tiffany's silver bracelet NEVER tarnishes while wearing it..
2,"I agree with the other review that this is very flexible plastic and not as sturdy as expected. I also found that it needed to be a little bit longer. Because they aren't very long, we have a problem latching it on our rounded cabinet hardware. I wouldn't recommend this product. It does the job though, just not sufficiently."
2,"This book does not live up to its title ""Complete"". It does not give enough examples for different types of scenarios. It does not do an effective job explaining how to tailor a letter to different needs or addressing or defining legal concerns. That's what I wanted when I was looking for a book. Unfortunately, it was about the only thing on the market. I do like the way the book is set up; it just does not go into enough detail to be completely useful. This book is a start in the right direction but it is incomplete. If I had to do it over again, I would not have purchased this book."
2,"I've heard such good things about Burke, so I was pretty enthusiastic about reading Cadillac Jukebox. But for all my enthusiasm, this book just didn't do it for me.Burke's natural writing talent is obvious, and he grabbed my attention right away. The characters are all very human and real, it's a great setting, and things click along at a brisk pace. I found myself zipping my way through this book eagerly awaiting the next surprise.And then, about halfway through the book I just got lost. A thousand different things had happened to Dave Robicheaux, his cohorts, and his enemies, and though each scene was written well, it just wasn't coming together as a whole. I realized that I either didn't know enough because I hadn't read any of the previous books, or Burke was just all over the place.Over all a disappointment, but since this is my first Burke book, I plan to give him another chance by reading the first of the Dave Robicheaux series."
2,"Remember the good old days of J-Horror? When Japan was cranking out horror movie hits like The RIng, The Grudge and Infection. Well, the Sylvian Experiments tries to bring back those days. But, unfortunately, it fails. The pacing is too slow and there aren't really any genuine scares in this latest release from the land of the rising sun."
2,"We got this for our shower. Our son is now 2 and the only thing we've used is the nail clippers. Which I actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot easier to hold then just the tiny clippers, especially if baby starts to squirm a little. I couldn't even tell you where the rest of it is. The spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is cheap and useless. Any baby medication you buy you'll get a dropper for which works way better. The bulb didn't work well at all, just keep the one you get in the hospital, those work best! And if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit still while I tried to take his temp. I recomend a therma scan for that. Just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go.So basicly, I would recommend to pass on this item and just get a pair of nail clippers."
2,"With a 5-year-old grandson in New York, I was interested in the nanny scene and, on impulse, ordered this book from Amazon. While in some ways it was an entertaining (though often painful) read, it felt more like an extended cartoon than a genuine novel. Literature it ain't! Be forewarned."
2,"I've read every one of the excellent books in this series and always look forward to the next...this one, however, was disappointing. Starting with a far-fetched reason for Jack to be in Israel, and building on that shaky foundation, this was not up to the author's usual standards. Next time, let's stay home!"
2,"Is difficult not to think of the first game mostly cause in the second one there is very little or no challenge also the rewards are not as good as in the first game, although there's some new minigames and the chance of training before the real game. in general 1st one was better."
2,This looks fine. Easy to use and all that. But it took a lick soon after I bought it and I just pitched it and went back to the old faithful rod type gauge. The light still worked so I think it more than just a battery.
2,"I thought that with Gillan, how can I miss? This is one of the worst Gillan cd's I have ever heard, not an interesting memorable track on the entire cd. Gillan fans be warned."
2,"I purchased this microwave 14 months ago from Amazon; it's seen light duty since, and it worked quite well. But one night a couple weeks ago, it died in the middle of a cooking cycle--no lights, no control panel, no action. The credit card I purchased it with will extend the warranty, but it's really not worth the effort to fix a $125 product. I hate to relegate it to a landfill, but apparently, it was made to be disposable. The Panasonic I owned before this lasted 12 years (and longer--I got rid of it because I wanted something fancier--this model)."
2,"This series is usually very good. But this one leaves you with not much more knowledge of JavaScript then when you started. It gives you plenty of examples to follow, without telling you the How's and Why's. You don't learn JavaScript so much as follow directions. Very dissapointing."
2,This book contains 100 pages if you count blank pages (really 50) of 12 different patterns repeated 4 times on low grade paper. As tiling patterns go these are somewhere well short of ultimate.
2,"This was my 3rd or 4th attempt at getting a reliable ear thermometer. With this particular one the readings were always different, even within a matter of seconds, and depending on which ear was used. A difference of a few tenths of a point would be normal but differences of a point or more is not acceptable. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the ease of use of ear thermometers in general, but in hindsight, this one is not even a tradeoff for ease since I had to buy yet a different brand, which, by the way, I am extremely pleased with. Check out my other reviews to find it.One other comment, this model of Lumiscope is a 2215, and there is one that seems to be exactly the same model for a very different price. I don't have time to check it out but you might want to read the info on both before buying one."
2,"I was looking for a book about how to surrender to the Universe, this book isn't it. It's about one woman's challenges. If you are a control freak who can't receive a gift without feeling like you need to reciprocate immediately, perhaps this book is for you. I don't think it applies to most people though."
2,"Eight years after the events of Child's Play 2, though that the makers of the Good Guy dolls, can't seem to help but to try to keep the factory going after what went on with one of their dolls. Just when Andy thinks that he can possibly get on with his life, Chucky eventually makes his way back to him in some way. Upon seeing that Chucky had found out where he is, what he don't know is that he had found someone `new' to play with and try to transfer his soul into a human body, and tries everything he can to help put a stop to him for good. That doesn't stop Chucky from unleashing some hell on the way and killing those who get in his way in any possible, though eventually this time it ends up that ends up being his downfall. Overall I give Child's Play 3, 2.5 stars out of 5."
2,"Although this book is called a ""classic"", and listed as appropriate for 5-year olds, I think it's better suited for 3 or 4-yr. olds. I won't even read it to my twin grandsons who are 5 because I think they'd be bored silly. It's very dated as far as children's books go."
2,had trouble finding out how to put it together--- then the motor started and would not stop--- had trouble getting the bottom in the right angle to stop it and then the slightest movement and it would go on again.I would return it but it is too heavy to move--- heavy to move to make it change to mop part from brush part and making the motor stop was a formidable task.I will let he battery run out and try it a few more times and try to use it just as a heavy mop. that should not take too long.
2,"Sonic A2B is a mediocre game, plain and simple.___Pros___Fun 2 playerSome fun levels___Cons___Average graphicsBad cameraAwful voice actingNo four player racingTerrible storyI wish that Sega would get it throught there heads. Sonic is not a 3-d game. I loved it back when it was a classic 16-bit Genisis game. If they could make a 2-d sonic with Gamecube quality graphics, it would rock. Oh, and take out that chao garbage. It is not fun. In fact that is what gave the game a 2/5 instead of a 3/5. Get sonic for the Gameboy. That is a truly fun experiance."
2,The bells are well made and make lots of noise... BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE ADJUSTABLE VELCRO CLOSURE AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS!!!! which makes them unwearable for adults and they easilly fall off kids hands! They can't be attached to a belt loop or handheld or ankle! very disappointing.
2,"I tried, I really did. The first season, I tried three episodes and just couldn't stand it. I give it a star for Baldwin because as hard as it is to admit, every Baldwin is talented - whether hilarious comedy or drama or action, I enjoy them all - most of the time. The other star is for being so good at impressing the award committees. Whether it's because everybody knows everybody or because they make the kind of funny that the elite media types like or they made a deal, I do not know, but they deserve a star for being able to beat some of the best shows on tv without having to be one of the best shows on tv. That takes talent - or something. Sorry but it just doesn't compare, not even the same league as The Office, Big Bang, Pushing Daisies (more a comedy within a drama, I guess) and so many more. I tried after they won all the awards to watch the second season and it was worse than I remembered."
2,"It's a Buffy the Vampire Slayer tie-in book. And the first one I've read. I don't know how it compares to the others, but it was a rather interesting experience. I counted one mention of Cordelia in the entire book - I thought she'd deserve more mention than that?The book is made up of six short stories, and the first story confounded me at first, but as it went on, it seemed to have a storyline that was present, but by the fifth story it had disappeared.I, on a whole, would not recommend this book unless you are a die-hard Buffy fan that has to read the novels too. I think I'll just stick to the tv show from now on, unless I get really bored."
2,"Handlebars have two ends. If you want a mirror at each end, you want two of these. It is a well made part, but I wouldn't have payed so much if i realized it was for one."
2,I order this Pasta Set. It is beautiful but arrived with a chip. I had to order a replacement. I hope the next set isn't chipped.
2,"A compilation of pieces from Esquire and Fortune over the past twenty years or so is what we have here. Kind of a mixed bag, at times very funny, others not so. I found myself wanting some of the articles to go on longer."
2,"I bought this album, like many people this year who were looking for decent music in todays bad times for rock, along with Foo Fighters 'In Your Honor' and Beck's 'Guero'. Of the 3 CD's I purhcased that day, this is by far my least favorite. Very dissapointing. I am a fan of Weezer's old stuff, and the single ""Beverley Hills"" was good, which made me think the album would be, but guess what? The album turned out to be a boring, sophmoric emo album, something I would never buy if I had not had previous respect for this band. I like ""Beverley Hills"", ""This Is Such A Pity"", and ""We Are All On Drugs"" (""Your My Best Friend"", for some reason, has also started to grow on me). Other than the aforementioned songs this album is sophmoric emo crap. I believe I will sell it."
2,"The toy is cute, but the website is not adult friendly, let alone child friendly...needs way more work!! Not very much to do on the site, and very slow loading...webkinz is way better."
2,"this books gives no advice on how to make money, it's all about blablablabla ..... it's a waste!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think we can all agree that donald trump is many thing but certainly not a good author !"
2,"An undeniably impressive display of guitaristics, Workin' Out is also more than a little cheesy. There's lots of down-homey and atmospheric numbers to showcase how versativel Kessel was, but precious little of real jazz value. Workin' Out is fun to hear, but only if your mood is cheerful and utterly undemanding, and it's in-your-face virtuosity might be of greatest interest to guitar students -- expect that, if I were learning jazz guitar, I'd personally rather sound like Kenny Burrell or Jim Hall. Kessel later gravitated to television and studio work, and it's not hard to hear why."
2,"The words Hell in a Cell can strike fear into most any competitor. Its unforgiving steel can shorten careers in an instant. Brock Lesnar and Undertaker, however, show no fear in this WWE Championship instant classic."
2,"Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci make this movie. Very good performances by those two, especially Thurman, but this lead ""actor"" is horrendous! What a waste of ten bucks. This guy can't act to save his life. The story line is boring. It's tolerable if you enjoy period films, and again, Thurman makes it, but seriously - otherwise, a total waste of time."
2,This book was a huge disappointment. I can't believe Oprah recommended it. The writing was amateurish. The story was obvious. I wouldn't read this author again.
2,"Although the design is wonderful, I am very sorry to say I am greatly disappointed with the quality of this dresser.Many of the interior pieces have no finish applied to them, most notably the drawer backs. The back of dresser is a piece of cardboard which is nailed in place.Also disturbing is the top was damaged in several places, despite no damage to the shipping container. This seems to be a recurring problem, which other reviewers have mentioned. Most of the areas could be touched up, however one area in the left rear edge is dinged badly and is defying any means of touch up.One plus in addition to the style of the unit, is the drawer glides. They were challenging to install due to an error in the instructions, but they work wonderfully.For the money I would expect at least quality with all pieces finished inside and out and a laminated back to the dresser.I would also hope they package the top better to prevent the damage that seems to occur from shipping."
2,"Well, like others here, I really wanted to like this product. And like so many espresso machine buyers, I came back from Italy with hopes of brewing the perfect espresso. I ordered this machine with high hopes for Valentine's Day and although it arrived right on time (thanks Amazon) the pump did not function and I spent a half a day trying to figure out if it was me or the darn machine - I called customer service from Capresso and they were very eager to help me, ultimately telling me they'd send a new body right away. However, the next day they called again and let me know it'd be early March before they could ship out the part. So, I returned it to Amazon and ordered a new one, it also came rush order (Thanks again, Amazon), and this one would not switch from steam to coffee - it was stuck on hot water. I believe this product is just too cheaply made, which is just too bad - this company is supposed to be Swiss, but this machine was made in China. I give up - [...]"
2,The plot seemed to lack direction. I've come to expect really great stuff from Nicholas Sparks but this time I felt disappointed.
2,"I've now grouted five different major tile projects, and am not impressed with the performance of polyblend grout. In both natural gray and sandstone, the color was very uneven in the finished project. It looked fine until the grout was thoroughly dry, but then some spots still looked dark (like they were still wet), and other spots were lighter. The problem has persisted for 10 years in one bathroom and four weeks (so far) in another. It's not my technique, because I didn't have the same problem with the Laticrete brand."
2,I have nothing else to say except that it doesn't work. Used up the whole bottle on a certain area and scarring is still exactly the same.
2,"This poster could have been my favorite , but it was printed on cheap flimsy paper . I'd recommend finding a shop that has clearer images and sturdier paper ."
2,"This was a ok video the ladder match and jerico vs rhyno were decent.BUT THE OTHER MATCHES WERE TERRIBLE.Angle got messed up badly by austin and was about to win but he got [messed] over.I was waiting for this cage match to get good but it didnt.The rock vs booker T was pretty [bad] too,because I dont like the rock or booker T, if anything I would want booker T to win.DO NOT BUY RENT IT ONLY!!!!!!!!"
2,"I bought this movie, basically knowing it would be awful and I wasn't disappointed. All the reviewers on here are right (except the two that gave it 5 stars) -it is a horrible movie. BUT, I gave it two stars.Why, you may ask? Because I read the great book by the same name, and it was very cool to see the scene with actual footage of Spahn ranch. (burned down not long after), and to see the scene with authentic hippies.The rest of the movie is throw away. If you want a good movie, don't buy this. If you loved the book, or are very interested in the Manson trial/family and want to see footage of Spahn ranch, here it is. Be warned - you'll get five or ten minutes of hippie/Spahn ranch footage."
2,"I have been an avid fan of the series for years (feels like decades). I bought this book anticipating the best. I am disappointed. This book doesn't even really pick up where the last one left off. More to the point, it describes the event from another characters aspect and location around the time Rand cleanses the source of the taint. It does proceed forward a little, but not by much. This whole book could have been summarized at the beginning of each chapter related to the character involved. This was a huge waste of paper and time. I will continue to buy the books and read them, because I am too far in to not know how it ends, but give the public some credit. People will stop buying the books if you don't keep them interested. This book was not interesting at all, and rather boring."
2,Coax seemed OK but the coil had several kinks making it unuseable except for patch cords. Kinks destroy the characteristic cable impedance.
2,"We all thought they were so pretty and festive. However, when they were washed, for use, the red paint on the stems, peeled off. I now, have to return them, and we are very disappointed in them."
2,"After reading Christopher Rice's first book, I was expecting another good one. Yet, I was very disappointed with this book. It was too much of guessing who did what and why they did it. I was left feeling confused as to the motivations behind some of the characters actions. Not enough of the characters' past was revealed, which did not help explain their psychological problems. At the end, the reader is left feeling as if so much has happened yet nothing was resolved."
2,"Although I am anti-Bush and I generally agree with Moore's viewpoints, this book could have been a lot better. Instead of wasting pages making fun of republicans, Moore could have developed more meaningful arguments against the right-wing agenda. Although I think some of the stuff he says is amusing, we can't fight the right-wing by just going on about how stupid they are. We need something more substantial than that."
2,"The frame was broken at two edges. The box it came in was fine and the corners were secured with cardboards so this was NOT a shipping issue. Glass for front and back are great but the material this frame is made up of is flimsy. Despite that, it would still look great on the wall if only the frame had arrived in a single piece. I should have returned it but managed to superglue and hang it anyways which sadly also means no other picture will ever go in this frame. Looks good on the wall. Hoping no one gets too close to it."
2,"I picked up Reaper knowing what I was getting into ... a technothriller not a literary classic. Still, even the wildest plot line needs some semblance of logic. Here the two ""ordinary"" people who are the main characters possess every ability known to man: brains, athleticism; plus knowledge of medicine, science, computer technology and criminal techniques. I'm surprised they didn't build their own cars from twigs and tape. And I think the chase scene at the end may still be going on. There are some interesting scientific concepts here if you can fight through the papier mache characters to get to them. It was a disappointing book ... probably because it was a really a screenplay."
2,Very disappointed. Tried to read the first few chapters multiple times. Still do not get the purpose for RDF.Sort of like looking up a word in the dictionary and having a recursive definition.
2,"Nice looking shoe. Wasn't the shade of ""cognac"" that I would have preferred (expected something a tad lighter in color). Took a chance in ordering a half size larger because that's all was avail; and it was being offered at a rather inexpensive price. Comfortable initially - plenty of cushion. However, after two wears, heels started to slip while walking and toes started to slide forward. Shoe is also a bit heavy. If I had to do it all over again, I'd attempt to get this shoe in my true size, which I imagine would be very snug initially, and attempt to break them in after three to four wears. Overall, I'd give this shoe 2 1/2 stars out of five."
2,"I feel that this book should be a must read for all new parents. This book has the best advice on how to calm your baby. I appreciate having this book as it works for my daughter. The advice in this book is priceless. It really works. This book is what will turn your ""colicky"" baby into a bundle of joy.[...]"
2,"That's pretty much the last time i take a recommendation from Amazon sight unseen. We have a pretty regular ""game night"" around here, ages 22-30, and we have enjoyed quite a few games, both drinking and sober, and I'll say this: the vikings would be disappointed. We tried this game both while drinking and while sober, and both times it sort of stank. It's a large collection of poor sexual innuendo, simplistic interface, and unchallenging gameplay. You're supposed to secretly pick one of four products, then select one of several slogans to advertise that product, read it aloud, and the other players guess what you are advertising. Unless one or more of your players has had a partial/full lobotomy, there's not much challenge to it. We quit about 1/3 of the way through when drinking (and i got chastised for bringing such a lame game to the party) and when sober we decided after a few questions that we'd be better off with Pictionary. So there you go."
2,"I opted for the ""unbreakable"" coffee press for my office as the previous glass carafe did not fair well in an office environment. My high hopes were short lived as the plastic portion of the filter started cracking after a few months of very infrequent use and then broke into half a dozen little pieces in a little over a year. It appears the manufacturer placed their focus on creating the unbreakable carafe while neglecting filter quality all together. I am now left with a carafe- just a carafe."
2,"I am now going through what everyone else is talking about.Finding replacement bulbs. For $20 this is unfortunatelyfor some a ""throw away"" mirror. At least ours lasted morethan 4 weeks."
2,"This is actually a cute book with some nice photos of grandmothers and children. However, I was looking for a book that my son could give to his grandmothers as a gift, and this book is not at all appropriate for that. Many of the entries are either a little weird or simply don't apply to his grandmothers. Examples: ""I love Grandma because she steers me away from the wrong friends,"" or ""I love Grandma because she lets me jump on the bed."" If you're thinking about making your own personal version though, then this book would be good to use for ideas of what to say and what kinds of pictures to include."
2,"It is understandable that Lou Gramm was given a chance to sing, but, in spite of his surgery and weight gain, the video is poorly shot (there are scenes from a hotel lobby doing registration and taken shots of the tiles!!), the camera work is very poor, the sound is lacking, and of course Lou Gramm is but a shadow of his prior persona. To keep the memory alive, check the older stuff."
2,"I really liked Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion was true to the Austin book, but the casting wa strange, Emma and Mr. Knightley had no spark, Norlthanger Abbey was so badly cast and acted I could not watch more than a few minutes. Since that bad experience I have not had the desire to watch Mansfield Park, but will do so one day. On the whole, the collection was disappointing."
2,I was so excited about getting a coin purse. Especially one that was handmade. I'm upset because I received a plain old black and white one which wasn't even in the picture. It also felt a little weird because I'm black. Also I can't ever seem to get this thing open. I try extremely hard and it takes me about 12 tried to open it. It would really help if they let you atleast describe what you want like say you want it colorful or not plain or something like that.
2,Be prepared for a book that spends a significant amount of time advocating alternative life styles.
2,"I just had to say that when I read the other review that said the clowns in here were too scary looking, I chuckled-- until I took a look at the book myself and saw them! Today I was in B&N and saw this book, and I must say those freaky clowns on each page ruin this book. I love these I Spy books, but although I don't get scared by clowns, I do wish they chose a set of cute little clowns instead. Try the Spooky House I Spy book-- so cute and fun!!"
2,"This is great reading for the ditzy, hormone driven teenage girl group. Call it romance or whatever, it is just drivel!"
2,i watched this movie on the showtime.i expected it to be as good as body chemistry 4. but to my disappointment it was not. rather it was silly and very illogical. silly ending too.
2,"I bought this Thermocafe along with the smaller .5 liter version, and both stopped working in less than 6 months. Apparently the vacuum seals are made made of a cheap grade of plastic, and wear out quickly. Hot drinks are not kept hot, and cold drinks do not not stay cold."
2,"It came without batteries and I have not purchased batteries to see how it works. Too bad. Seemed like a good idea, but I DO wish it had come with batteries."
2,It's a film that many Canadian's can relate to. It's a story about three hockey fanatic brothers and a controlling mother.I don't wanna waste too much time on this film. I'm gonna keep it short. The acting in this film is quite good most of the time. The story is good enough to keep you interested. The problem with this film is the poor direction and photography. It seems like these guys only had one lens with one focal length. All of the hockey action in this film is ruined by poor camerawork and a lack of imagination. It's like they shot the hockey scenes in a rush cause they couldn't afford more rink time or something. It completely ruined what could have been a great indie flick. Half assed.If you're gonna make a film about a sport it might come in handy to know a bit about sports photography.If the camerawork wasn't so crappy I would have given this one 4 stars.
2,"This is a poor rewrite of a much better book, Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision, by Hartley & Zisserman. It fails to clarify any of the more difficult concepts presented by Hartley & Zisserman and is far less complete in the treatment of the subject matter. I can not recommend this book when a better written, more thorough treatment is already available from Hartley & Zisserman."
2,"I have been a huge fan of Tom Clancy since high school. Red October was the first 'non-required' novel I read. I have come to appreciate the detail he works into his plots, but this was rediculous. The first 500 pages were not only slow, but boring. I got tired of hearing how Jack Ryan hated being President, how much Nomuri enjoyed having sex, and how much money everybody could be making if they did not work for the Government. Slow, redundant, painful. Keep this one in the bathroom and work through it over the next year."
2,"I love Jane Austen and this version of Mansfield Park, well, who ever decided on the costumes should be fired. Through the entire movie I kept telling Fannie 'put your hair up'. The Bertram's would have had her put her hair up and have her be presentable. For her and all the other women, I kept wanting to tell them 'cover your chest'. The dresses weren't even from Jane's time period. The only thing I LOVED about this version was Edmund's discovery of loving Fannie and his mother's awareness to support it."
2,"I agree with other reviewers that the Blueray filming & costumes were excellent. However, the most important thing about a ballet is the choreography, and here it it frequently boring. I also don't feel that Chopin's music fits the story or the choreography very well, so sometimes it seems to be simply background music unrelated to what is happening on stage."
2,"This scanner didn't do half of what the ad said it would do. I bought it to scan color photos, (Which it failed to do). It dumps a lot of software onto your hard drive and it does not uninstall in a clean fashion. You have to hunt down all the crap it stored and ""Force Remove"" the garbage out of your system.It scanned Black and White materials perfectly, but no color."
2,"While the book covers some interesting aspects of mid and high model rocketry, it is not as comprehensive as other books and dated given the advances in the hobby of the past years. If you are looking for a book to complement your model rocketry library, this will be a useful addition. If you are looking to take the step from basic model rocketry into mid or high power model rocketry, there are other books that better describe ""how to""."
2,"I've yet to see a movie or read any fiction involving a nuclear power plant that was anything but silly. Writers: just don't go there if you don't know what you're talking about! Now, the forensic stuff in Patricia Cornwell's books is fascinating. She knows that field very well, but the power plant thing was an idea best forgotten. It shot the whole climax into total silliness for me. Granted, I have the advantage of having worked in a nuclear plant for 16 years and not everyone has that. The plot probably worked ok for most people, but for me, it was a serious blow to credibility."
2,You'd have to be on drugs to like this crap. The whole concept is F'd up! I think the writer and/or director must have smoked alot of stuff before they filmed this! The biker helmets look more like they're glasses than it resembiling a skull. If you like movies that really suck ass then this is for you! I'd rather watch paint dry or do nasty things to my cat with a plastic fork than ever watch this again!!!
2,This book has some great insights into the frauds put out to the public. It also gives the reasons why trusted people would deliberatey deceive the public.
2,The lenses were smoke im a surgeon so... Does not work for me cause i need to use in the operating room
2,"When I saw the previews of this movie, they were simply hilarious!Unfortunately, another case of the best parts of the movie being those parts in the previews, with the actual delivered product not living anywhere up to the hype.There were a few chuckles if you can wade through to the last 1/3 of the flick. Otherwise, forget it."
2,"This book is pure sleep-walk. I kept hoping, wanting to embark on a heroes journey, but never got there. Nothing can match the hollow feeling you get when you're finally done. To call it shamelessly open-ended is an understatement. If an unknown author put forth such a plot-less, pointless novel, it never would have been published.Nothing binds this story together -- there is no premise, there is no fulfillment. Characters wander in and out for no reason. They possess melodramatic qualities (i.e. the sexual harrasser - how 90's). It's the worst bit of dramatic writing from someone who should know better that I can remember. And, it's the most shameless, cynical attempt to sell a sequel I've ever seen"
2,"i got this cd for christmas so thank God i didn't have to spend actual money on it. i am a die hard LB fan, but i could have wailed in agony when i played this cd. ""Break Stuff"" was unrecognizable, so was ""Nookie"" 5 versions of ""My Way""; did Fred get bored or something? ""Take A Look Around"" is a bright spot, but what's with the ""player, hater"" spiel at the end? The ""my way"" remix with P. Diddy was good and energetic, but i got tired of his ""this is the remix"" monotone in the background.OH God, i dread the next studio album; no one can replace Wes!! Please please tell me this is not the end of my beloved LB!"
2,"If you're new to Joni Mitchell-don't look here.Apart from Night Ride Home and about half the tracks on Wild Things... this is a poor selection of her talent.I've never been able to listen to Chalk Mark or Dog Eat Dog albums without cringing, despite the fact that musically Joni is in my top 3 artists of all time.Only buy this if you want the demo tracks and the packaged photos and notes; otherwise borrow copies of seperate CD's before you decide. To me, it's just a marketing ploy to rake in the dollars for the unreleased demo's. An expensive investment for little return."
2,Cheap. Cost and quality about the same. Nice picture on the DVD case. Quality looks like someone pressed multiple copies off the original. I got the one that must have been pressed last.For the price O.K. but I woudn't spend any more.
2,Some good-looking people in a poorly executed movie. The editing was bad and so was the sound. I thoroughly enjoy over-the-top slasher movies. I watched this one to the end only because some of the actors were hot. Not a complete disaster but close.
2,"I went out on a limb and purchased these wiper blades at a premium. It took less than a month before the blade itself slipped out of the metal guide. While the blade can be positioned back into the guide and works great when functional, every week or (2) I have to fix the same issue. I have used this new style wiper from other brands, and this is the only one that has given me this issue."
2,"I bought this camera to be able to shoot close ups with the macro mode. Very disappointed. I was never able to shoot at close range and have the the picture turn out. Very grainy!The software was not easily installed. You need to read the directions from 3 differant instruction booklets that came with it. A little bit of info from one book, a little more from another etc. I purchase this thinking it would be a great camera from reading all the ""great"" feedbacks. Not sure why someone would recommend this one."
2,"This thermometer died after a month. We suspect that some liquid got into the temperature probe. It's not really water resistant.It comes with a magnet on the back for putting it on a refrigerator, but it's not strong enough for us to feel safe doing that.It doesn't have a timer function, just a temperature alert function.Not worth the money."
2,"I have bought several of the Dr. Suess Bright and Early Board Books, and they simply don't stand up to the abuse a toddler dishes out. None of the other board books we own have fallen apart the way these have."
2,mostly silly shows and plots. time to kill this series. how dare they make a joke out of a very strong Stephen King character. This series drifts so far away from the Johnny Smith depicted by Christopher Walken in the movie.
2,"Earth has been subjected to another ice age and the people have degenerated as they struggle to survive. Emigrants from the stars rediscover earth and decide to ""help"". Their help consists of taking valuable museum artifacts and selling them at huge profits. The ""icemen"" are considered not much above Neanderthals and are kept helpless and at subsistence levels.The iceman hero, Michael Jivar, manages to incur a blood-debt from a highly placed official. He is maneuvered into marrying the niece of the official so that the he can win a political election.My purpose in writing this review is to warn people that this book does NOT end happily. So if that's important to you, don't read it. I was quite disappointed. I thought that since Felice had managed to work several happy romances into her other books that she would have done so in this book. NOT SO!"
2,"Patrick Larkin is hands-down my least favorite author of this series. His books are slow reading and they fail to capture the true character of Jon Smith from the previous books. For instance, in the previous Covert-One books Jon is very careful and very good at his job; now he is clumsy and keeps making mistakes that ends up in shootouts. Normally I can finish these books in a couple of days but I've had this for two months now and I'm still just half way through."
2,"The Lounge Lizards are not the best live band. They stand out for their clever songs, which, honestly, are much better presented in a studio setting, where the average picking and okay singing can be put in their best light. If you are new to this band, spend your money on one of their excellent studio albums."
2,"I was very disappointed by the latest book of Michael Crichton, of whom I am a great fan. What I appreciated in his earlier books was the capacity to treat various issues (about society, science, ethics) in a highly entertaining way. But his latest book seams to have been wrote more for the movie that inevitable will follow rather than to convey some idea. The story is packed with action and centered on a group of American students sent beck to Medieval Europe. But the ploy is weak and highly predictable, with the group going through fights with Medieval knights as easily as having a game of Ping Pong, and ultimately the story start to repeat it-self, with the end where ""the bad guy"" will pay for his arrogance."
2,"""The Go-Getter"" was not the movie its Trailer suggested. There was a consistent story and competent acting, but parts seemed contrived and unrealistic. After a while watching, both of us yawned and wondered how much longer the movie was. If you are killing time, maybe a good item, but the pace was slow, no real drama nor adventure. Could be titled ""Pacing Through Life After Stealing a Car"". Not a recommended buy."
2,"Compared to it`s cousin ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" (long enough title?) is pretty god-awful. First off, it was totally blatant that the film tried to live up to Scream`s quality, but it fails miserably. 2 out of the 4 lead actors can`t act (It`s pretty obvious who), and the plot is pretty vapid and stupid. In fact, the plot is an example of what ""Scream"" jeered at. ""IKWYDLS"" has the basic running through the woods, killer with hook, unexpected jumps, ""open the door!"" substance that gets tiring, FAST. The only positive thing about the movie is it kept the gore to a minimum."
2,"Aside from a suspenseful sequence with Courtney Cox trapped in a recording studio, this movie is just terrible. Jerry O'Connell tries valiantly, and Courtney and David are fun to watch together, but this sequel forgets that it isn't satire if it's just as bad as the thing it's satirizing (like.. oh.. Friday the 13th Part 5). But worst of all is the ending: beyond stupid, it drags and drags and drags... how can any of the fans of this movie bear to sit through yet another LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG ""Why I had to do it"" explanation by the killers? It's not funny, it's just plain BAD."
2,Some people might not be interested in this book.The first time a read it it was great.The second boring.
2,"These stock pots are a good size, but much too lightwgt for my purposes. for an extra ten dollars I purchased, from amazon by the way, a much heavier 18/8 pot with five-layer bottom. They are probably good for someone who is able to spend the time in the kitchen while cooking is in progress, and needs something budget-minded.Concord 18/10 Stainless Steel 20 Quart Stock Pot With Glass Lid"
2,"This is a poorly presented ""training"" video. The various participants spoke off the cuff. That was fine for demonstrators of various abilities, but the main participants were mainly interested in pushing the product.There appeared to be no script and no editing. More than a few times a club face was described as showing something, but the camera angle did not show what was intended.I used the ""transferable impact ink"" pen and after about 8 hits, the pen was dry and I could not mark any more balls. I tried to send an email to the company about this but was unsuccessful."
2,"Some Funny moments and some good stories, but way too short. The type setting and tons of pictures left you with the impression of a college sophmore trying to pass off an essay by volume. I had the feeling Bill wrote this in his spare time to fulfill a contract. It's got that disconnected feel of ""I've got a couple of minutes, I'll work on the book""I love Murray, but this was a real dissapointment"
2,"There are people who have died before seeing the ending of this story! Loyal fans for years, and years, and years. I wont be one of them.I got about halfway through Book 10, closed the cover in disgust. I no longer had patience or interest in going one page further."
2,"I love the concept of this (with the steam basket) and being able to cook an entire meal at once, but this product barely works. I push the button down to cook and the light flickers. I must repeatedly set it until it will cook. I'd advise you to either buy another brand or only buy this from a store so you can return it if it's not working properly."
2,It'd be okay to rent but not worth it to purchase. Not as humorous as the preview let on and cursing was a little excessive.
2,"Oh boy! I was expecting suspense from this book, but no, not enough of that to be classified under this category. Apart from the lack of proper dose of so call suspense, a few major drawbacks I found were that the story line was loose and flat. The authoress introduced too many characters in the story that it distracted readers and could lost their focus. If this book was a borrowed book, I would have stopped reading it after the first few chapters. However, since I paid every penny for it, I tried very hard, really very hard to finish it hoping something good and grasping would turn out eventually - telling myself that the money was not badly spent.Although the book was disappointing to me, I am giving it a 2-star because I think I have to be fair in giving the authoress credit of writing so many words, and her effort behind of creating so unneccesary distracting side stories.Sorry! I will not buy another book by Susie Moloney."
2,"I purchased this book on the basis of reviews that said it gave new insight into the workings of U.S. juries (which have certainly been mystifying of late in highly publicized trials). The author is so self-involved and pretentious, however, that all the musings are through a glass darkly. He considers himself a jury of one with regard to his fellow jurors, the officers of the court, and the entire judicial system, and he strives with the single-mindedness of a bad graduate student to fit his experience into his academic intellectual constructs. The judge, and some of the other jurors, in the case must have found him laughable. The weird ""true crime"" underpinnings of the ""intellectual"" gloss remind me of Victorian painters who disguised their lasciviousness in Greek and Roman props. A big disappointment."
2,"This is a poor Spider-Man story. Marvel simply took many of its popular charectars and had them slug it out for 14 issues. If you are interested in Spider-Man, I suggest you buy Fearful Symmetry or Hobgoblin Lives."
2,"I found this encyclopedia to be boring, overlong and slackly written"
2,"The Nanny Diaries in theory was a really good idea--exposing the lives of insanely rich Manhattan socialites and their lack of care for their children, etc, and what they put their nannies through. The intro (about the first 5 pages) was perhaps the best part of the book, excellently executed with a style and grace lacking in the rest of the book. The rest of the book really isn't that bad, but the writing style drags it down. It is written almost like a teenage-girl would talk, and it gets incredibly annoying. You find the authors saying things like "" OH my ..., there goes my Harvard HOTTIE! OMG he is so cute!"" etc, and it just takes away from the story. This book could have really said something about this secret subculture of ignorant rich parents, but instead is ruined by its show of idiotic language."
2,"I am not one to leave books unfinished, so I plowed ahead with this one, but it would have been easy to walk away from this ""Sex in the City"" meets ""Nancy Drew"" groaner at any point in this thin plot. It very much reminded me of the dinky paperbacks I loved as a preteen, where the heroine always had an adventure of some sort and then reluctantly fell for the last guy she would have expected. The book borrows heavily from the character set-up of Sex in the City (although projecting the supporting characters down the altar) without the finesse -- I lost track of how many times the phrase ""multiple orgasm"" is used (the pursuit of which might be considered the theme of the book). If you want fluff, you'd be better off in front of the tube. If you want a thoughful, sexy, well-paced novel: you'll have to keep looking. How I wish I had!"
2,I'm in love with the books and looked forward to seeing the dvd's as they had great reviews on NPR. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. The quality was horrible. The dvd kept skipping and even reverted to English dubbing from the Swedish subtitles on its own. I don't know if this was because the dvd was produced in Mexico or what. I will have a difficult time buying a dvd from Amazon again.
2,The only problem with these is that when I went to cut my son's hair along his neck line it actually cut his skin and caused him to bleed. I have to use the small trimmer for finishing touches. Also it appears that the blade is crooked. I will probably remove the two large screws and see if there is any way to straighten them out rather than deal with the huge headache of trying to return the thing.
2,It hurts my wrist to slip this on and off. It would have been much better if it had a velco strip or something where you could wrap it around the wrist instead of having to force it on.
2,"Physics major from Purdue U.Author fails to have enough examples worked out as well as solutions to exorcises. Without feedback from the book, one is required to waste a great deal of time confiming solutions.A detailed solution guide would complete this text, if one existed! I encourage anyone to write one."
2,"Benson has managed to remind me of Dan Brown, with all of the bad writing and none of the interesting research. The premise seemed interesting--tale set in the future and the past, with similar events.Unfortunately, the writing was so bad that I, as a respectable Creative Writing major at a university, could not get through more than the first five pages. If you like endless cliches, bad dialogue, and thousands of thoughts in italics, pick up the new John Grisham and skip this mediocre tale."
2,Received the set promptly after ordering. Washed the sheets before using. Removed the fitted sheet from the dryer and the pockets were coming apart at two corners. Had to sew up the pockets before we could use them. Don't expect the sheets will last thru the up coming winter. Would not buy again!
2,"No, I'm not mike jones, but that's about what the album sounds like.Never in history has a rapper mumbled this much, and he talks about the same bland and stupid topics adressed in EVERY SINGLE MOTHER F**KING RAP ALBUM SINCE 1994!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm starting to think maybe these rock fans are right. Maybe rap really is mindless garbage. I mean I'm not counting the good rappers, like Nas, 2pac, Outkast, etc. But, I AM talking about dumb ones like Lil' Jon, and all the other ones with ""Lil'"" in their name. They all suck c*ck. Next thing you know he'll be calling himself Lil Mike. Ha ha, can't wait to see that happen...."
2,This item was much smaller than it looked in the picture and smaller than it was described by the seller. It was grossly misrepresented. It is about the size of a beanie baby. I read all the information on this item before purchasing it to make sure it was what I really was looking for. I feel that I was taken advantage of. I will not order anything like this from amazon again.
3,See book summary above.It seems to me that Clive Cussler is lending his name to some up and coming authors. Maybe he should have read this again before putting his name on it. This would have made a heck of a good story if it had a little more depth and characterization but it was presented with too many characters who were given too little time. His next solo effort will surely blow this one out of the water.
3,"I was looking for a comfortable, long lasting shoe insert. Any inserts I have found in other stores, just didn't hold up. The SmartSole inserts are comfortable, and brought new life to my sneakers, but I have not seen nor was I expecting an insert to help with cellulite, unless you are exercising daily as well. Nice product, should only be worn in sneakers. I tried to put them in regular shoes, but they made the shoe too tight."
3,aka Absolute Proof. Book does make compulsive reading but some of the situations that Cole Egan encounters suits a JAckie Chan type of screenplay rather than one in the style of Forsyth or Follett.
3,"We used a return credit to buy this for our infant. It's just a simple crinkle book that can be bought anywhere. He doesn't really seem interested in the teether portion, just the crinkle pages."
3,"This score of the classic trilogy's music is a passable overview of some outstanding music. Although the amazing Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme) is included, I am left wondering why Luke Skywalker's and Ben's themes were not. The bottom line is that this is an ok choice if you don't want to spend nearly $100 for the 3 movie soundtracks. However, I now plan on buying the soundtracks for the prequels as they are released, rather than just a summary."
3,"This book is rapidly becoming dated. However, it is a collection of very diverse opinions on the current (as of Dec 04) situation in North Korea. Ranging from the neo-con to direct engagement, the reader is treated to several well researched analysis and opinions on the current geo-political situation with North Korea. If you are a reasonably well educated person who is trying to get up to speed on Korea, this may be an excellent selection."
3,got what I ordered but it wasn't what I expected it to be: wanted only to connect two different antenneas for one TV when the 'old' bradcasts were all converted to 'digital.' Didn't work out.
3,"I'm a little disappointed that the sheets barely fit on our matress and they are not quite as soft as I anticipated. They have a nice weight to them, however. I washed them before I realized these things, so between that and the good price, I kept them."
3,"The book was entertaining and keep my interest ,but I feel Patterson could have done more with the subject of genetic engineering. This read was more like a fairy tail. I cannot wait for the next Alex Cross novel."
3,"I first saw this movie many years ago from a friend of mine who recommended it. I thought it was very funny about the premise, where the US always loves to rebuild countries that it defeats in wars. So this country of Fenwick decides to declare war on the US and lose so they can get money, as that their requests seemed to fall on deaf earsin Washington.Anyway...There really isn't any war in the movie, nor any real violence in it. Peter Sellers does a great job playing 3 different roles too. William Hartnell (the first Doctor of Doctor Who) also is in the movie, as a supporting actor to one of Peter Seller's many roles.Could have been better, but I still love it. I own the DVD and liked it."
3,"As a fan of Bogart movies,I found this to be an interesting read, even though it is really a collection of Bogart stories, told by his old friends. Humphrey Bogart died when his son was only 8 years old and his memories of his father are as sketchy as one would expect. What annoyed me was his whining attitude towards his father for dying and leaving him (as if he could help this !) and towards his mother, for her love and loyalty to her husband. This was a much loved and cherished child who blamed all of his failings in life on the fact that he was left fatherless as a child, but enjoyed a loving home and what would have been a fine education if he had applied himself and stopped drowning in self pity."
3,"Okay of course someone saw that I love Gangsta movies, and books and suggested that this had to be one for the collection.I love Robert DeNiro, and James Wood, and seeing them together cinched it. Okay now with saying that this DVD isn't like the best caliber. The movie is missing something I've watched it a couple of times to see if it were just me and I still have no clue as to who was looking for Noodles. In the middle of the jewelry heist the movie just stops it doesn't say put in next disc.It's sslloooww(...)!Don't get me wrong, I like the flashbacks and how pertinent it is too the present I'd just like to know who in the hell was trying to kill Noodles!My first Jewish mob story it's not way Gangsta but it does hold it's own."
3,"this is a lovely line of fragrances - each is subtle and appealing. I bought a this scent in june '09 - and unfortunately, by november '09, it has altered and become 'soapy'. so, i think either the shelf-life is nil, or the product was old when i got it. i've never had an oil-based scent turn so quickly.the packaging is adorable - the scent was pleasantly powdery before it went bad. it isn't cheap, so i wish it had lasted."
3,Ehh...I wasn't too impressed with this polish. It looked like White-Out on my nails and chipped/peeled very easily. I guess I expected it to be a little more sheer and not so chalky white looking.
3,This book gave me a few new ideas. I found it to be a inspiring read and I liked the format. Its not a book worth buying though. I suggest you check it out from your local library instead.
3,"When opening the product, the sticky adhesive was not evenly distributed to maximize the trapping area on the card. You may need to use some type of spatula to spread out the adhesive so that all areas of the yellow card are covered. After that, the product should work as advertised."
3,"I can not write a positive review of software that is upgraded because the previous version (2004) was sunseted after only 3 years. I find Quickbooks unimpressive but useful. I do not like the pervasive intrusions to buy other of the vendors ""upgrades"". I need simple accounting software. I can see that any continuing relationship with Quickbooks will be tenuous at best. My accountant wants me to convert to Peachtree but I will continue to use this software until the next sunset."
3,"Excellent in content, but the proliferation of erotic art make it unsuitable for classroom use (that is for 6th graders studying Ancient Roman Civilization). Recommended for mature viewers only."
3,"I got this book because I have slumber parties a lot. Well Its fun, but a lot of the quizzes are the same and it gets old after a while. Once you have taken the quiz and all your friends have too it's pointless. We got bored with it really easy."
3,"Some of you may have seen the movie ""Money for Nothing"" with John Cusack. Some of you may even like it. The movie is partially based on the true account of Joey, a Pennsylvania drug addict, who back in the early 1980's caught a break in life. He found $1.2 million that fell off a truck and over the course of a week managed to lose most of it, before getting caught by FBI. Apart from the incredible luck this man had, nothing else is much interesting about what happened with him. Readers of the book will find out the numerous stupid choices he makes in an effort to keep the money.Bottom line - the book is interestingly written, but the story is ridiculous and doesn't deserve the time it takes to read it.- by Simon Cleveland"
3,"Robin Williams is very funny. Joan Cusack is always goofy. Jack warden always shines. But this movie featuring those talent is one over stuffed movie. This only has about 1 belly half every 30 minutes, but the script seems to keep it going. Robin Williams doesn't look too happy, but Joan Cusack does. playing brother/sister they together must stop his evil brother from making dangerous war toys. Micheal Landon plays the evil brother, and Jack Warden plays his father. Very long. Not for young children. Naming this movie Toys was bad. The movie talks about sex and there is gore. Very cooky."
3,Purchased this as a gift and it arrived faster than I had expect. I am very pleased with their service.
3,"Interesting but shallow. It presents seven African animals in a normal length film, therefore it dedicates not much time to each of them. Video quality is good. I have seen better films on African animals."
3,It was an interesting movie but I did not like the movie because it was a bit too real and too bloody.
3,"This was a breath of fresh air. Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) is outstanding as the lead actress and the rest of the cast are not bad. The special effects must be seen to be believed, I mean flawless, if you like very real looking gore then this the movie for you. They even have an English audio track for those who are feeling lazyor just to stoned to read the subtitles.See it friends its a good one."
3,did not fit and returned product. I made this mistake of not planning well on this product and to return it.
3,"I watched this DVD with very low expectations, realizing before viewing it that it was a low budjet movie. The story is that of a twentyfive year old guy, that has moved away from his home town to LA. He returns home as he find out from his friends that one of his best mates is getting married. However there is a snag: his best friend is getting married to his ex-girlfriend from high school. From here a story develops that is part comedy, part reflection on growing up, friendship, love and the nostalgia that is always shared with people we have been close to in our younger years.This is not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed watching these carachters at work...Almost every single character reminded me of someone I knew in real life. The friendship interactions feel quite realistic and I got more and more involved as the movie progressed, after a lukewarm start. A good movie for an otherwise boring evening with nothing to do."
3,"Just finished Kildar. John Ringo is a good author, and I generally enjoy his books.The first book of the Paladin of Shadows series, 'Ghost', was oddly enjoyable, a forbidden pleasure. Whatever you could say about it, it had action.This book was 400 pages of shopping, followed by 5 pages of shooting, and then it was over. Obviously, this story was intended to be the setup towards something happening later in the series. It was the construction of Mike's personal army. It had some similarity to the ""March to the Sea/Stars"" books with regard to training indigenous folks to be ""modern warrior/soldiers"" but that's to be expected.The mystery of the Keldara was interesting as a diversion, but by and large I found myself saying, ""OK, when is Mike going to kill some people and rape their women?""It's going to be necessary to read this to continue the series, but I sure hope the next books have more fun and less planning."
3,"Not my favorite nonetheless an enjoyable book. If you haven't read Grisham before, I would recommend - The Firm, Runaway Jury, The Partner. Those will keep you up all night."
3,"the player itself is okay, but the instructions are minimal and of little use. it took me several days and a call to the techhelp line to get it to work. and i'm still ironing out the little bugs."
3,"This is a much better mystery than many of the others that are out there for the age group.The good: The length of the book is perfect. It appeals to students that don't want to read. The cover is decent, students find the cover appealing enough to pick up the book (and that is often half the battle). The story detail makes it easy to visualize what is happening.The bad: Parts of the book do drag. The connection between the dreams and the ""actual"" events may be hard to make for many 10 year olds, causing some confusion with the ending. There are a lot of unexplained events. Too many for my opinion.Overall, yeah, students pick it up. Some get it more than others. But, for the most part, they want to read it."
3,"i'm still hangin with what i have planning before which is open a bookstore. about this book, it's really suitable for those who have cash in hand to become a bookstore owner, for those who just plan you better generate your cash first before go through this book."
3,I purchased this product for my Mother and she said to me that it relieves her pain tremendously.
3,"This third book in the Jackie Walsh series is a nice, easy read despite the fact that the author seems to be a bit confused about the time the story takes place. Ex-cop Matt Dugan was killed ""last November"", which supposedly happened nine month ago. If I'm not mistaken (and I'm not, because this fact is mentioned numerous times throughout the book), this puts us somewhere around August. Yet on page 42 our heroine Jackie Walsh glances out of a window and observes that the dogwoods and azaleas are blooming in the spring air.Even if the term ""spring air"" is just an expression of artistic freedom, last time I checked, dogwoods and azaleas don't bloom in August.Despite this little slip-up and the fact that Melissa Cleary is not exactly in the same league with Susan Conant and Leslie O'Kane, I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the other books in the series."
3,"My son received this when he was about 7 months old. He is now 10 months and continually tries to stand up using the hoop as his stabilizer. The problem is that the hoop detaches easily, so when my son pulls on it, the hoop falls and my sons chin hits the base. Although he loves it, I don't believe it is safe for young children."
3,"If you liked Howard Dean, do not buy this book. You already know that Bush is a ""say one thing, do another thing"" lier. As such, the book will simply repeat what you already know.What you may not know is that Eric Alterman is also a ""say one thing, do another thing"" lier. While Eric regularly excoriates other journalists for their lazy bias, he engages in the same practices when it suits his purpose. Indeed, Alterman helped sink Howard Dean by repeating -- over, and over, and over -- right wing attacks on the good Doctor."
3,"I must say that when I heard ""My Favorite Mistake"" on the radio, I thought, this one, was going to be, Sheryl's best album ever. But when I bought it, I was so dissapointed, there wher too many tracks that I just didn't get, or didn't click for me. ""There Goes The Neighborhood"" it's supposed to be a party song, but it's a lil' boring for my taste, ""Riverwide"" makes you wanna sleep. But let's not focus on the wrong's, the best tracks here are of course the leading single ""My Favorite Mistake"" still a fav, an a classic, so real and anthemic, ""Difficult Kind"" so intimate ad heartbreakin', ""Members Only"" a more party-fun song than There's Goes The..., over all this third delivery of Crow didn't equal the success and music of ""Tuesday"" or ""Sheryl Crow"", because it sounded boring and sad(but not a sad song that you enjoyed), here are some good tracks that you will enjoy, but the feelin' of the album could kill those great tracks, I would say half is good the other not."
3,"If you don't come away from this movie with the feeling that ""That's the way things are headed. Oh Dear Lord!"", you're not trying hard enough. It's like 1984, or Brave New World. Read up!Maya Rudolph is beautiful, there I said it. This movie was well-crafted all the way around, including the aggravating opening DVD interface. It tells the story!!"
3,"Amazon, as usual, shipped my product quickly and I received it on the date promised. I know I would have to assemble this but the set up process wasn't too taxing and I had it ready for use in about 45 minutes.I transfered my movies from a small book rack and after some tweaking with the shelves I quickly filled the rack.It comes with a strap and wall anchor to stabilize the rack but this only keeps the rack from falling away from the wall. The rack, however, has a noticible tendency to sway side-to-side. My rack sits on a laminate floor so I can't tell if the sway would be more pronounced on a carpeted surface.My rack is roughly 50% full. Perhaps once it is full it sway less or more. I don't have any small children wandering around my house but if I did I would be more concerned over the stability of the rack. But then if you have small children you would be better off getting an enclose media rack."
3,"Really like the sounds this makes but it will only stay on for 40 minutes before automatically turning off. Our newborn will start to wake up as soon as the sound goes off so I am off looking for a white noise machine that will stay on all night.Also, the sheep is not necessary, especially for a newborn. We never even put the noise maker in the sheep."
3,I have really liked the messages that Michel Sardou provides in his music and the variety of music genre as well. This CD seemed mostly uninteresting (although there are few good songs on it). Guess I just like the old stuff.
3,"This was my first digital camera, back in 2002. I liked it cause it would take weird pictures that would make great photoshopped images. The image quality is ok, pretty decent I would say.Nowadays this camera would be okay for kids and such. It's fun and so are the images it develops..."
3,"The tuning and sound of this radio are great. The light could be brighter, although some reviewers stated it is too bright. The instructions for how to set up the alarms, etc. are not very clear. I still have only one alarm set and don't know how to set it so it doesn't go off on the weekend. All else has failed so I'll take another shot at the instructions. I still like it enough to buy it again should something happen to this one."
3,"I love the voice of this young lady from Ireland...the scenery of this country is lovely but I prefer Chloe's performances in front of live audiences rather than just walking around Ireland. To see her at her finest, watch the concerts of CELTIC WOMAN instead."
3,"This is an extremely elementary book of basic tactics. A book I might have read at age 12 when I first learned to move the pieces. I acquired ""Chess Tactics for Kids"" by Murray Chandler at the same time for my 5 yr old grand-nephew(too advanced for him); it is more advanced than GM Polgar's book for ""Champions"". I am not a rated player, have played perhaps 30 over-the-board games in my life. I haven't played, except sketchily, in 30 yrs. Whether or not the positions are from Champion games is irrelevant. Champions(and there are millions of their games) make terrible over-the-board mistakes. This is a book for beginners. I regret I bought it, and can only put it up for my grand-nephew....I think he'll be ready for the ""Champions"" book within the year, after all, he's five and just learned the moves(if he was, say 8, with more mature learning skills and patience, he'd be ready now). 3 stars because it is a good chess book, just, deceptively labeled and marketed."
3,"I kept wanting to be knocked out by this book, but I just wasn't. Sentimentality didn't override scampered execution. As a dog owner with a very faithful pooch who also follows me everywhere I go without a leash, there were moments I really enjoyed, but this story just kept falling short of the mark.If you're not a dog lover, forget about it. You'll want to roll over and BE dead just a few pages in, yet there is something there for those of us who know the love of a good canine. It wouldn't be my first choice for a read, but Timbuktu doesn't come in dead last either."
3,"This book does a good job setting the scene for ROTJ. It moves at a good pace, with a satisfying ending. Darth Vader has been well characterised. However, in light of the release of The Phantom Menace, Darth Vader's preconception of his own force skills in comparison to his son's are a little awry. Also, I do not believe that Leia could be taken in so easily by Xixor(whom incidently started my sistor off with naming every character in the book after a piece of platground equipment). Over all, a good read."
3,Easy reading; not complicated but designed for 5th to 7th grade students. Some passages didn't flow well however. I would not buy again. Good for upper elementry or middle schools.
3,"Got this for my 2 year daughter. She like to clean and we thought this would be good. It has the mop, broom dustpan etc. The quality of the mop and broom can be easily improved to make it a great product. The bristles should be soft and the edges on them should not have sharp corners. Can hurt toddlers and your walls :)"
3,A little flimsy but will work for what I need it for.Have to be careful so as not to break the little drawers.
3,This is the 3rd book of the Rogues of Regents Series. It was ok light reading. It didn't hold my attention to the point that I couldn't put it down. I guess it was the times when the men didn't listen to women and thought when they made a decision it was accepted without question.I would have like to see more interactions with the three Rogues in the 2nd and 3rd book.
3,"It took me great perseverence to get through this book. At times I found it utterly uninteresting - this self-obsessed whining about relationships that are going the wrong way, the details about boring parties, all the repeats when describing the characters. I suppose it's a good thing Leavitt didn't make his own life and character look better- but maybe he should have. I don't really like Martin Baumann, nor his friends, nor anyone. Which should not be a problem if you feel that the person is experiencing mental growth. Here, none of that happens. Leavitt used to be good for his pointed, measured sentences. Now he's blabbing along for much too long. The earlier books may have been as he admits here - untrue and gloating - at least they were a better read."
3,"Ours seems to work ok. It doesn't get great reception on our living room but it's workable. I can see what she's doing from the couch while I watch my shows. The static noice doesn't seem that load to me. the volumn does not seem bad to me unless you turm up the volumn really load. I even run a fan in the babies room and still not much static. I would recommend buying this from Walmart or Babies r us and saving your reciept in case it doesn't work for you. It's hard to return things you've bpught online and TARGET is really strict about thier return policy. Do not buy any baby gear there. I'm serious. Walmart, Kmart and Babies r Us will take things back, no questions asked if you have a reciept and will ussuallt replace or give store credit without a reciept."
3,"The movie is a liitle bland, as per the writing of the times. It took me until the end before i figured out the 'message' of the play."
3,"Could be that my expectations were way too high, but the one thing I really wanted on this disc wasn't there - a commentary track.I won't bother to review the series. If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought the DVD.Video and audio quality are good, so no complaints there, but the hidden extras are unfunny and go on way too long without a payoff. Metalocalypse's art was never its strong point, and here even the dialogues and monologues are boring.I buy DVDs to listen to the commentaries and learn more about the stories and the creative process. Big disappointment."
3,"This part can be made to work only if you have access to a good quality tubing bender to modify the tubing bends. As supplied, the bends are only a vague approximation of the bends in the original factory part. This is a pretty crowded area on the car and the tubing must be re-bent correctly to work. Otherwise the part had satisfactory appearing quality for the price."
3,"I'm not a regular globe buyer but this one is satisfactory. The positives are many, including good detail, good base and overall good looks. The only negative is from the assumed hand glueing of the maps over the sphere. Some of the seams may overlap a bit or be short with a tiny bit of peeling. This all depends on how much scrutiny you look at it with. Anyway, I'm pretty happy with it for now but it may start to peel in the future."
3,"Ancient gods that have long been abandoned and forgotten by their followers are living everyday lives in America. The new gods of technology have risen to power. A battle is coming unbeknownst to the masses, and an ex-con named Shadow finds himself in a world he didn't know existed.American Gods is an original idea backed up with excellent storytelling from the author. The main story branches off into several different directions without losing its focus. The only problem - the ending.Despite the strong narrative in the first two-thirds of the book, the ending is less interesting than the original premise. American Gods is still recommended as a good read."
3,"This game is a lot of fun, but there are not enough levels. Also it doesn't have the same feel of being in a large world that you would want from a game like this. The fighting is awesome and wrecking storm troopers is well worth it, but don't dig too deep! You wont find much depth."
3,"Well I put it on, and It ripped a little. So much for strength, Not so good as I hoped."
3,"ordering batteries is supposed to be easy but when you get a pack that has a battery corroding in it you want to get the seller's attention. what I got was not a replacement but, ""I've never had this happen before"" so, I will look elsewhere for my batteries."
3,I enjoyed this series but I did find it got boring at times but I am glad that I watched it as I think Matthew Perry is great
3,"Rather than the title ""What Went Wrong With Vatican II"" this book should have had a title about the fallout after Humanae Vitae because that is it's main focus. It is an easy read though and, looking back now, was probably one of the first books by a main-stream publisher to critique the post-conciliar situation in a sound way. I think that it was fine for a few years ago but there have been more and better treatments of the subject since it came out."
3,This toy was purchased for my 9 year old daughter. She had the smaller babysitter pixel chix house so this was purchased to go along with that. The two connect and can be used together. This is a good toy for long car rides! A few glitches when the toy arrived-nothing a new battery could not fix though.
3,"Production values in this version of ""Wives & Daughters"" were amazing. The costumes and hairdos were so accurate for the 1830 period - well done. Story line was a bit slow, but I did not find Molly to be dull or priggish - I tend to NOT like the Cynthia character who is SO charming that every idiot falls for her no matter how shallow. I liked Molly and enjoyed her relationship with her father. The stepmother done by Francesca Annis, was very good. And Gambon's multi-faceted work as the squire was also excellent. Glad that Roger and Molly finally find each other at the end, although I doubt she would have worn pants in Africa, perhaps a divided riding skirt or bloomers? Not as good as ""North & South"" - (John Thornton character hard to beat) but entertaining."
3,This is a good book that gives insight into how to linkfaith and culture. It shows the impact of decisions by using some clear examples of how things went wrong.
3,I too had a hard time following the dialogue. I have no idea what they were talking about half the time. This would be better to have subtitle option for those of us not living in England.
3,I read the previous revies- stated you get what you see in the pic. You don't get the nose. Ears and tail are only offered in this kit. The tail has a wire in it -which makes it bendable. Ears are difficult to keep on but should do the trick for the overall costume.
3,"Bought this because it was the cheapest one I could find. Really, who needs a fan with a remote and a reversing motor and all that other stuff? Not me, and I'm betting most other people don't, but they buy it anyway for more money cause they haven't found this one yet.Also, the motors are supposed to be water resistant, so you can leave it in the window while it's raining. I'd be more worried about my rug than the fan if it were raining with the window open."
3,"If I wasn't so afraid that putting pressure on the board would crack it, it would be more fun - very expensive for quality - I should have listened to reviews - not worth it - make your own."
3,"I'm not a civil war buff yet Bruce Catton's simplistic writing style and ""everyman"" vernacular made the subject easy to approach and informative without making it too technical or academic for me to enjoy. The chapters relating to the soldier Geyser and the war seen from his viewpiont and that of the engineers gave me a new insight as to what a monumental task moving an army in that day and age could have been. As well, it was interesting to see how both sides shared conversation, singing and other interests by night and then fought each other during the day, as brothers often do.I'd give it more stars but the 1981 paperback edition was not edited to it's best realization. Extremely poor syntax, misspellings and bad grammar in parts were somewhat annoying, especially coming from a Pulitzer Prize winner. These things could have been shaped up at the publishing house quite easily."
3,"Christians have heard this argument a thousand times, but few really know what people mean by saying that little in Christianity is original. This book provides you with the reasoning behind this claim in an exhaustive way. I found this book to be a much better choice than any of Robert Price's books because Price gets his ideas (or most of them) from this author. For a good counter-argument I recommend The Jesus Legend by Eddy and Boyd."
3,This is a well built muffler but it is a bit louder than I was hoping for. Considering the price I can get used to the noise level.
3,"I like this CD and listen to it occasionally. Some of the tunes really swing out, man. I'd like to hear more of Steep's Theme, but it's only 30 seconds long. What's up with that? I guess that's all it is, just the theme. Lots of good playing here. Thank goodness the dreaded bass direct was not used, though I would have liked to hear a few bass solos so that the absence of the dreaded bass direct could be fully enjoyed.The liner notes are terrible. It seems like they were put together as an afterthought. I just want a list of performers and composer credits for each tune, is that so much to ask?A good CD, but seems to lack a certain je ne sais quois. I think it lacks a commitment to some sort of artistic ideal. Not that it's not artistic, it just isn't focused. I enjoy it, but after listening feel as though it could have been better somehow."
3,"With a title like that, I expected a very dumb movie, but it wasn't bad.....actually decent. It's a harmless cop-fantasy film with police drama mixed in with some humor and special effects.I found a lot more drama than humor, which surprised me, although there were a few funny lines by the ""gnome,"" a special- effects creation of Stan Winston.Despite a film filled with angry characters - cops and crooks - the language was pretty tame and the film moves well and zips by since it's only 84 minutes. Yes, the story is ludicrous and some of the dialog is B-movie, but it was pretty enjoyable.Sorry to see this unavailable in any form. Boy, if I had known that, I would have kept my VHS copy."
3,"A pesar de mostrar de alguna manera la realidad marginal de Medellín, Colombia, en un crudo relato, Fernando Vallejo aprovecha la mala prensa de esta región para exagerar y distorsionar la verdadera realidad. Debe leerse con cuidado, ya que la ficción abunda"
3,"Although this book can be quite useful for basics, it is too laden down with useless titbits. Also, a lot of important stuff is hidden between these, so it can be very easy to become frustrated. The book is presented well, slightly too much light humour but it does at least presume that you (like I did) have no experience. Practice will make you a much better photoshop user than reading this book, but combining this with thousands of F1 searches will set you well on your way."
3,"I can understand that perhaps musically Gene and Dean want to spread their musical wings and create something a little more weighty and ambitious than their previous albums (all of which I love). The production is certainly nice on this record, but to me they've somehow lost the sense of fun, quirkyness, humour and spontaneity that attracted me to their sound in the first place. Ween are obviously trying to get a little more commercial with this release. Sadly at times I'd go as far to say that White Pepper can sound pretentious and contrived. If you're new to Ween, then I'd recomend Chocolate and Cheese, and if you're not you'd proably agree."
3,"Book arrived on time and in good condition, I was excited to read the book after all the amazing reviews here, however I found it an average reading.. I did not expect sex advises in it, because other readers have mentioned there arent any there. However I was expecting something more hot as a reading in terms of more insight of her job and so... If we follow the book we get the idea she has hardly slept with a few carefully selected men(and women) and also have done a few movies, which is not the case. I even found it at some moments quite boring to read how she gets hooked on a guy, alcohol or drugs(sometimes together) and cant let go... it could be just my feeling, but it is that i feel something fake in this book and it was interesting to read how she started and what her life in general was, i just couldnt feel this book as an impressive one.."
3,"For a band with such a creatively rewarding career(especially the golden trilogy that preceded this album-Giant Steps,Wake Up,C'mon kids)Kingsize can be viewed as nothing else than a colossal disappointment,a major drying out of the fire they once undoubtely posessed.While C'mon Kids had been a sprawling and colourful canvas of diamonds and quirky shifts in direction the boredom that haunts Kingsize borders on intolerable,or even annoying at times(particularly ""Free Huey"").Evidently,for a band so accustomed to the craft of memorable pop songs some are found here but in an appalingly short quantity-the only standouts being""The old newstand at Hamilton Square"",""Monument for a dead century"",""Jimmy Webb is God"",""She's Everywhere"" and thwe awesome ""High as Monkeys"".I would recommend this album only to hardcore fans since it could give newcomers a completely different idea of what the Boo Radleys are all about but then again the choice is yours."
3,I'm on the highway a lot and enjoy listening to music without words. Composer John Williams is one of my favorite composers who has written many Movie Themes and this one is up there with other famous themes he's written that I especially enjoy.
3,"This book is somewhat fun and entertaing. However, I must say that I am not 100% sure it is all true, based soley on two things stated in the book that I know 100% for sure are NOT true. 1) NFL cheerleaders do NOT go on the road with the local team, and 2), the next time I see someone walk past a cocktail waitress in Vegas and snatch a drink off her w/o serious repurcussions will be the first time I see it. I realize these may be considered petty issues, but it immediately made me wonder how much of the balance is true. One would kind of like to believe in the whole story, but I'm not too confident in that. But if you can look past all this, it is a fun read - just don't bet the house it's true."
3,Doesn't hold a charge for very long... not like my old one did anyway. It works though so I'm happy with that.
3,"not so good for a woman thats 5""11"" and 160 pounds. Seems like the quality is fine though. can still wear this but I squeeze out the top a bit. :("
3,"Meg Cabot's books are great... it wasn't my favorite series ever but hey, they were still good. But I'm not writing about the books. I'm writing about the search pages. Yahoo, Amazon, Google, etc. they haven't been giving the list of characters. I have a report due tomorrow, and I read the book months ago... ( the teacher gave us a due date & then changed it til after Christmas)... I can't remember what that girl's ghost's name is... I mean come on... would it kill you to give a list of the main characters!!!! Grrrrrrrrrr! O, & by the way... that isn't my real e-mail address. :-P"
3,"I got this machine and the De'Longhi BAR32 Retro, one for the office and one for at home. Both were working great for one year, and then the pump lost the ability to generate sufficient pressure, so that now the coffee drips quite slowly, rather than flows from the dispenser. Lime residue (calcium carbonate) is not an issue, as we live in an area with soft water, and as I descaled the machines regularly. I also use the same ground coffee in these machines as when I bought them, so a coffee that is ground too fine is not an issue either. If you want something that lasts, don't buy these."
3,"While I do think that Ms. Pulliam Weston knows her stuff, I don't think she covered the things I need to know in enough depth, and some of my most burning questinos were not addressed at all.She speaks mainly to people who have somewhat stable finances and are capable of following her suggestions. What do you do if you need to REALLY repair a VERY bad score? The scores she considers to be ""bad"" are in the mid 500s or above. She assumes that you probably want to tweak your credit a little and have a higher credit rating already, for the most part. She only briefly addresses the concerns of those of us who really have credit problems.I'm giving this book a 3 for those reasons."
3,"I like all her DVDs and was eager to try this one, but I was disappointed because it was hard for me to follow her. And although I did have my sweat, I wish I didn't feel so out of sink with the steps. The DVD is an inspiration, she is wonderful, but I have a long, looong way to go before I get to move as easily as they do. If you are familiar with ballet moves, than you will probably love this workout."
3,"Great inexpensive trunk but had to replace the lighting kit before even installing on bike. Used radiantz led and have had no further problems, original lighting was just to cheap to even waste the time to install."
3,"An interesting look into the future. The brain child of Director and Writer Andrew Niccol, I enjoyed this movie, but I feel that his other two films The Truman Show and Lord of War were superior."
3,"and versatile. Has many different beams and a cool remote. The remote was kind of tricky to use; it didn't always get the laser to respond when I wanted to change modes. Also, the beam isn't very powerful, and even with a red plastic target it's hard to see in the sunlight. The included red goggles help a lot. Now I'm hoping to find a laser target to attach to the survey rod so we don't have to sped so much time trying to see the beam on the rod...Basically a great tool at a good price."
3,Hotel World started out strong and then petered out. By the time I had gotten to the long run-on sentence chapter done by Clair I had lost interest in the book.
3,The canvas band is horrible.. the blue face is really nice.. but the canvas freys and makes it difficult to use.. after wearing it MAYBE 10 times I had to get my son a different band. I think id still get it tho.. for the price the blue face is real pretty!!
3,"I started out my preparation with this book. I needed a lot more prep work than average -- I've been out of school a while.The math review was good, but the exercises (for the most part) were not like the actual GRE. Meaning, they were not multiple choice -- you had to solve the equation/problem completely. Then if you got it wrong, it wasn't explained to you how to correctly solve the problem. Not a big deal, but it doesn't help you learn how to use the 5 multiple choice answers in order to solve an equation. Other books teach you to use what info IS given to you, to help eliminate answers.The verbal and analytical writing sections were good, but it helps to have been a lifelong reader. That is the only way the build a vocabulary in order to beat the GRE.Also, this book is available at many public libraries. So buy Barron's Passkey to the GRE here on Amazon, and use ETS' book for a reference."
3,"Does anyone know the name of the techno song that was playing when Tom had the mask on in the Club? If there were more than one, I'm after the one Tom was dancing too(if you haven't seen the move yet,sorry)?"
3,"i've tried quite a few, and this one is pretty decent.i don't get the ""turbo"" because why would you ever want less power? so i just put it on turbo all the time. that being said, some older trimmers (that have more metal) have more power than this one.the adjustable head works well, then you can take it off for close shave. it could be closer... not the quality of a barber's tool with a really clean, sharp cut.the vacuum feature is pretty gimmicky. yes, it does capture quite a bit of hair when you're trimming a longer beard (making clean up a bit easier), but this does not mean that hair does not fall. it does and you still need to clean your sink afterward.that being said, this is still my daily beard trimmer and i don't see a need to change yet, but i would if i found a better one."
3,"I can't really put my finger on it, but it's just not what I expected for a beginner yoga DVD."
3,"Freaky Friday is a great book about a little girl and a mother who hate each other and suddenly they wake up one morning and they are each other! They have to go about their entire day acting and being different people an on the way, they run into all sorts of odd situations.This was a great book that kept me entertained for hours and always kept me on my toes. It is kind of a suspenseful book and I would recommend it to people of most ages. Actually, I would recommend it to young children and teenagers.I enjoyed this book because it was more laid back than most books that I have read. It was somewhat of a children's book yet still is entertaining for most anyone."
3,this album sounds pretty much to any other power pop album it comes with limited horizons nothing to special an average album over all
3,"Bong rippers unite. The new sound from the band sweeping the Bay Area will have you dreaming of yummy surf, fish tacos and cold cervezas. While not overly complex, OPM's sound is a mixture of revitalized ska and a hint of more traditional Bay Area sounds like Train and Stroke9. Don't expect to be moved to a higher level, but be sure to keep this CD handy for the Saturday barbecue with friends."
3,When I received this watch I said: Nice Timex ! Testing the watch I realized that the light was out of order. A couple of days after the alarm turned off. The battery was finished. The dealer refund me... but what I was looking for ??? I was looking for a Timex not for a refund. So bad.
3,"Gordon Wainwright made the involved science of body language an easy to understand and interesting topic of his book. Each chapter gave full explaination of all facets of our unconscience method of communicating. I particularly enjoyed the simple field tests he suggested at the end of each chapter which enabled the reader to fully undrstand on a first hand baisis what impact our slightest body movements have on others perceptions of us. For anyone interested in discovering the seceret messages we transfer to eachother everyday, Gordon Wainwright's ""Body Language"" holds pricisly what they want."
3,"I finally made up my mind to buy an iPod, and it is the best MP3 device that I could ask for -- and I have had several others including the RIO 64MB, and the nomad jukebox 6GB.One thing to be aware of with this model is that this is the older 10GB model and I was both pleased with the iPod and disappointed at the same time. I kept looking through the box for the wired remote and case (being a true geek the temptation to clip anything to my belt is great) but they were nowhere to be found.I had foolishly bought this model thinking that it was the newer, lighter iPod with the wired remote and the case. This is a great MP3 player and probably the best value of all of the iPods, but I would have paid the extra few dollars to get the newer one."
3,"This is a very fun game. Two pirate ships try to ""sink"" each other by sending cannons over to the other one. Beware - it is a VERY large game and takes up a goodly amount of floor space.I really do like this game, but it has two big drawbacks. The first is obvious, it takes a lot of space! It takes space in the cupboard and space on the floor. Not an easy game to just whip out. The second is its high cost. Not unreasonable for what you get, but very pricey for a game that is finished in a matter of minutes.If you love pirate ships, have space and cash to burn, this is the game for you!"
3,"Hello. I am just reading this book. My flatmate said she has tried this diet over a decade ago with not such great results. She said just after the book was written the ""experts"" came out with a finding that less than 60 carbs a day will result in long term brain affects. After all she points out that your brain works on sugar. No sugar-no brain. It won't really effect your intelligence per say, but it could possible have adverse effects when you get older. You could suffer from Alzheimer's disease and other health related problems. I am still going to give the good doctor a try, because while these things ""may occur"", being over weight is also a health hazard and considering it's more relevant now than later, the risk seems to be just like any other risk; like driving to work or flying on a plane. Good luck to you all. Ps. I will let you all know my findings in the months to come."
3,"I like the camera, don't get me wrong. It does a nice job taking pictures, movies and has a lot of storage with the SM card. Very easy to use, nice large display. The bad, be careful when you open the compartment that holds the batteries and storage card. The clip that holds the flap down is made of soft cheap plastic and breaks very easy. I have to use packing tape now to hold it together It should have been made of metal. If you take a picture or movie and use the zoom control wait 3-4 seconds before you take the picture or your image will be out of focus. I found out the hard way and missed a shuttle launch now I have a clip that is out of focus. The wife hates that it does not have a view finder, you have to look at the display to see what you are shooting."
3,"The music is as advertised, classis Leadbelly. But some of the CDs jump or skip when played, and don't seem to indicate an end when it is over, leaving the CD rattling in the player."
3,"I expected much more from Kite Runner, given raving reviews all over. Perhaps given these high expectations, I was ultimately very disappointed by the book. Emblematic of this is the story's denoument, when tension is meant to be at a maximum, and the suspense revolves around the bureaucratic hurdles of immigration into the US. Amir's transformation from recent emigré to succesful author in America implies Nabokovian talent for writing in non-native tongue. Another highly implausible incident is the incident wherein Amir learns about his mother from a beggar in Kabul - the coincidence is so incredibly farfetched Hosseini feels he need justify it as an example of Afghan culture.My overall conclusion is that Kite Runner is a ""lightweight"" novel that earned ""heavyweight"" reviews. For a more powerful book on Afghanistan try Philip Henschers ""The Mulberry Empire""."
3,I found this movie to be really slow and strange. From beginning to end it was just dragging by. Their is a narrator that speaks throughout the entire movie that is also very annoying.
3,"Sure this disc is deeper lyrically speaking..other than that it leaves little to the memory. After countless listens my 12 memories recall nothing that suggests a step in the direction of thier previous works or greatness. I hear people saying they are ""evolving""? Evolving into what? A forgettable sound.Sorry...Travis is awesome and perhaps LIVE can add some memories to this venture."
3,"Was looking for a good ""wired"" mouse for my MacBook Pro that was deadly accurate. Have several wireless versions but grew tired to changing batteries. Did some research on the net and found the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 came very highly recommended for graphic professionals.The Intellimouse is loaded with a host of features you can read about in the product description and those do not disappoint. However personally, I found the mouse to be fairly large and bulky for my size hand. Feels uncomfortably large. The wheel in the center has a rough ""clunk, clunk"" when you rotate and is not smooth at all.Otherwise, the mouse performs as advertised."
3,"I loved the style of writing and descriptions, but the story line wasn't captivating enough for me. And was there really something wrong with Turtle? We never found out. It rambled too much - but I still read it to the end. Not bad....will read Poisonwood next to give her another try."
3,"Shakers were great, but the stopper in the bottom of one didn't fit and contents would spill out.Sent them back 2 times and both were the same.I would buy them if the stoppers fit like thy should."
3,"I get frustrated when (1) spelling words my kids have don't show up in a dictionary, and (2) the root word or the word itself is used as part of the definition. Very frustrating! I teach my kids they can't do that! I'm sorry to say that a name like Merriam-Webster has instances of both of these. I'm switching brands."
3,"I had very high hopes for this album, and was let down. I was hoping they would have taken the music in a ""harder"" direction, instead they went to the lighter side of the road. I stumbled upon the band around the time of identity crisis and thought they were the best aside from the repetative drumming. Illusion of saftey was also great with improved drums. Maybe I haven't given the album a fair shot. I just feel it was sub-par."
3,I ordered the eyepiece extender because you really do need one so your face or nose doen't mar up the screen. The only thing is that I also ordered a delkin screen protector and you can not use the extender with the protector. Since it's more important to me to protect the screen I use the delkin.
3,"I found this to be a fairly good book. It was hard for me to put it down once I got more involved in the story. I gave it only 3 stars because the ending was disappointing to me. It did not seem like a plausible ending for this book, it was almost as if the author wanted to wrap up the story within a certain number of pages. I think I would have enjoyed the ending if it would have detailed more of what happened to the characters, especially after the tremendous buildup to the climax of the book. All in all, aside from the ending, this was a very good read."
3,"I enjoyed the first rainbox six so I thought I wud take a chance on this one expecially since it was so cheap. I also have the new Rainbox 6 360 games, so compared to those the graphics are seriously inferior. But the game is difficult and fun, I dont regret spending $4 and the game plays on the 360, a big plus."
3,"I picked this up at Tower becuase it was cheap. Plus I heard it was an OK album. The problem with this album is that it has the right parts (good singing, pretty good instruments) but the melodies never popped and the songs never quite went anywhere. It got better towards the end but there is nothing compelling to listen over and overMaybe their next effort will be better."
3,"I know, I know, not every album can be BlackStar--but let's compare for a moment. Why do two albums about the same general subject matter (uplifting the black man, putting food on the table, falling in love, raising a family, dodging the land mines of crack, guns, and crooked cops in the ghetto) sound so different? Cadence, rhythm, timing, and most important, cleverness that verges on pure genius in the utilization of similes and metaphors. Although Pumpkinhead has great production, and thankfully is one less MC rhyming about [...]/drugs/bling/etc., his lyrics only hint at these things.I put this album in the category of onebelo or Hangar 18 or Pete Miser: talented artists all, with a gem or two here and there, but lacking that certain something that makes you wear out the CD."
3,In my opinion he should have kept The Salterton Trilogy in Salterton. The characters in Europe where too real. I enjoyed the caricaturish Salterton characters much better. This book does seem to have a bit more of a plot than the first two but I'm not sure Davies is that worried about plot in his books. Guess I'll have to read the other two trilogies to find out.
3,"This movie has a very interesting storyline, with a fatally sick woman searching for one last love before she passes on. She just happens to find that in an older (abt. 48) man, which seems believable that her attraction would go towards someone of this age, since her time is even more limited than his own.It is a believable story, but the medical condition described, leaves little for the audience to hope for. The end seems inevitable, which leaves the characters to only enjoy the here and now. Which seems to be the entire point of this film anyways.It is a good movie, with an emotional storyline... however written as not to tear at your every heart string... but to just hope that Charlotte will have one more day with Will."
3,"On UP, Gabriel delves deep into the dark places of the mind and soul. The overall sense of fear, depression and despair is almost palpable. His lyrics are some of the most personal and moving he has ever written. So why 3 stars? Musically this CD would have sounded inventive and dynamic...5 years ago. The industrial sounds and jarring dischordant shifts have been the base for a number of bands, particularly NIN, for years now. The world rhythms that Gabriel had so well incorporated in his last few recordings are nowhere to be found on this CD, and that creative loss is felt. Too many songs drift off without any real effect on this listener (Ex:""Sky Blue,"" ""My Heart Sounds Like That, ""More than This""))until you focus on the lyrics, but the best Gabriel music has always been a blend of aural and mental stimulation and this CD does not hold up to the standards Gabriel has set for himself."
3,"Rosa Rita had nothing to do this summer, because her best friend Lewis is going to a camp. But her friend Mrs. zimmermman had a letter from her cousin, that he was dead, and the farm he had it has passed to her. And he had also found a magic ring. Mrs. Zimmermman invited Rosa Rita to try and find out more about the MAGIC RING.I did like the book, because I did'nt have anything better to do in class.I recomended the book if you don't have anythig better to do, but if you have opportunity to play soccer, or any of your favorite sports don't read it."
3,"Sequels are rarely as good as the original and Queensr?che's latest is no exception. I like it enough to play over and over at work but it doesn't blow me away like the original.No matter how many times I listen, I'll never get used to Pamela Moore's cheesy 80's singing style. She's the female equivalent of the guy who sings in those ""Real Men of Genius"" Budweiser commercials, even though he's doing it tongue-in-cheek."
3,"This book is the standard reference work to mixed drinks and cocktails and most bars have a copy. However, many of the drinks in this book were popular in the 30s-60s and are not ordered today. This is more of a reference work with hundreds of drink recipies. If you want to learn about the types of spirits, how to select a wine, etc. look elsewhere."
3,Dinged 2 stars for missing one of the protective caps. They are used for a reason.25 feet is excessive for my application. Although it is better to be too long than not long enough.
3,"Alright I read a lot and I love fantasy but this was borderline bad/good. Where the Ideas were Really great and had such potential it really didn't get there. It felt as if they chopped this book apart and skipped a lot witch can leave one confused. I had to reread some parts several times just to realize what was happening. Then when I did it was good, but then they called something by one name then another witch was fine but, stop going back and forth stick with one. I know if your working on becoming a Vet this would probably be much much better, but for us who aren't please just put a glossary or something at the back so we know a bit. I still liked it, it had good potential but it was obviously rushed."
3,"Catherine Texier writes with bitterness and hope, mixed with pain, anguish and denial about the end of her 19 year relationship with another writer. He has left her for another woman, his editor. Their relationship was based far too strongly on sexuality.The book is structured as a letter written to an ex-lover after a break-up. Both the author and her ex sound immature, volatile and creative. They also appear to have been indulging in substances too readily. I still questioned at the book's end if the author had really let go."
3,"when the edited one episode call ""wild thing"" they cut two minutes from the show. I dont know if was a mistake when they edit the dvd, or they did on purpose. The scene they cut out is when willie is in the garage, building the cage for alf. they cut the scene all together. if any body knows of any other mistakes on the dvd, or if the they are going to correct it or let me know.thanks"
3,"I prefer the old recording as I think there is more depth in the cast and, of course, the Philharmonia orchestra is first rate. Sam Ramey in his prime was something else, the first bass I had ever heard who could actually sing all the notes.If you want to see this wonderful underrated Rossini, come to the Santa Fe Opera summer of 2012 where they will be presenting the new critical edition of Maometto II with Luca Pisaroni."
3,"This amp kit is alright if you're wiring a small amp less than 500 watts and not wiring up a slammin system. It's good for maybe one sub or a couple of them, just not insane powered. I got this kit in the mail the other day and when I opened it, it looked great... When I went to install it into my car I had a few issues. First of all, the terminal rings are really cheap as well as the wire loom, and some of the wiring. The power wire is nowhere even close to 8 gauge, it has more insullation on the wire than there is copper, it actually seems more like a 10 gauge. The copper is really cheap used in this kit, it's so brittle it comes apart when touching it. Besides all that, the RCA's seem to be of decent quality, as well as the fuse holder. The speaker wire is a little small too, but for 12 bucks this kit does the job at the right price. Good luck"
3,"I bought this book for my psychology Research method class, we hardly opened the book but the few things I did have to look into it were helpful."
3,"These batteries have only a 3-year stated shelf life, as opposed to the more common 6-year shelf life for alkalines. This is probably old stock."
3,"I don't listen to this much any more, it used to be a big favorite of mine six years ago, my tastes have changed since then, but that does not stop me from recommending this as 3 Doors Down's best CD.but, what! Why three stars?Well, sir (or miss) it is one track that has the singular distinction of knocking off at lest one star off my review.and that track is... 'be like that', a song so monumentally awful that it made me cringe when I first heard it, with that memorable first line: ""He spends his nights in Calliiforniiaaaa..."" OH GOD, MAKE IT STOP!Brad Arnold has a voice that fits the rest of this album, except, 'be like that' it's so flat and lifeless there. Sad because the words have some meaning.Now that that is out of my system, a song I really thought was a real stand out is 'so I need you' highly underrated, it has all the thoughtfulness of 'be like that' but in a sound that fits Brad's voice.That being said this is a CD worth being in your collection."
3,"I somehow felt that the product was a little less than I expected: maybe it's because few cards were actuallly dirty, or because I found the design to be more simple than I grow to expect from mr Sabuda.But maybe I am just spoiled :-)"
3,"Of course, it is very nice to have pretty much every Carroll work you could want in one volume, however there is one major drawback here. While the blue leather binding and gold gilt text and page edges are quite nice, I found the actual pages to be a very low quality thin paper. Also, the margins are very small, cramming alot of text on each page, while the paper and print quality actually take away a minor of the illustration detail. Overall, not a bad collection, yet I think ""The Complete Works of Lewis Carroll"" thru B&N; is superior even without the bells and whistles.MK"
3,"A bit disappointing, though there is certainly a ton of information in the book. Probably a more suitable beginner's book, and less for someone who has been devouring and researching for years now. I enjoyed his other book more, personally."
3,"We only have one cat but I'm quite fastidious about cleaning his litter box and do so almost every time he uses the litter box, which is between 3-4 times a day. I was expecting the refill to last at least one month but it was used up within 10 days! That's expensive as it costs $8 per refill plus taxes. So I'm cleaning the litter box once a day now and I'll be looking out for the Diaper Genie at Wal Mart."
3,"If you are deciding to buy this... the advice I can give you is buy it if you are truly a fan of Hugh Laurie, it's a nice movie to add to your collection. Despite the fact that this movie is not Ben Elton's best work, but, I think you will get the kicks out of seeing Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, and not to mention, Rowan Atkinson, because these people are the reason why the movie is so alive and entertaining. Otherwise, the movie is so-so. Now to the DVD itself; this DVD version is highly-edited, I know that some scenes in the beginning of the movie are left out. I'm, somewhat disappointed with it. I guess you buyers can decide for yourself if it's worth buying, I hope this helps"
3,"I bought this toy for my daughter for x-mas. It is cute, sucks, makes cute sounds etc. It is kind of heavy though. The whole body looks very awkward with the legs kind of dangling and a very big belly. I didn't want to spend the money on the Chou Chou outfits and bought other outfits that are supposed to fit that doll, well due to her misshaped body none of the regular doll diapers fit and none of the regular doll clothes. So, be aware when you buy this doll that you WILL have to buy CHOU CHOU accessories which are just as pricey as the doll itself. So Mattel made that doll that way so you don't have a choice but spend more and more money."
3,"Unfortunately, I didn't realize that there is a serum AND a lotion version of this product. Not paying attention, I ordered this because it was 2.5oz versus the 1.7oz size. I do not care for the lotion version. My skin feels greasy like I put body lotion on it and I can only stand to wear it at night. Unless you have dry skin, I do not recommend the lotion version. My skin felt much better with the serum-I have combination skin. Hopefully, I will get the same fantastic results I had with the serum."
3,"This flick was just o.k for me,,,I'm not one to enjoy kung fu where the dudes fly through the air like birds,,aswell,,I'm not too into swords play,,that killed it for me. The story however, was great,,the fight scenes nicely choreographed. However, don't think I would re-visit this one,,,for me it's just a one time watch!!"
3,"This is a fairly unimpressive recording. But I don't know if it's the recordings fault or whoever decided to dumb down Grease. Songs have been removed, others inserted and the whole show just seems really silly and unimpressive. The lead vocals are ok, but some of the others (like Rosie O'Donnell) are a joke. If you're a die hard Grease fan then you might enjoy this CD, I myself don't care for it too much"
3,"It is ok, but the toy arrived in different condition than what the seller described. There were pieces missing and there were no instructions. Thanks to the internet and a good copy shop I was able to complete the game. All in all the game is good, alot like monopoly."
3,"Of the excellent Verve collection (Samba, Bossa-Nova, Forro, Afro-Brasil) this is easily the weakest release. Some good songs here, for sure, but others are strikingly thin and synthed-up. Instead, go with the Samba disc, or better yet, ""Samba Roots""."
3,"I got this to mix in with my weimaraner puppys hard food to try and get him to eat more when even if I was not in the same room. It worked at first he ate it but was not overly thrilled with it. After a few days he did not like it as much and only ate it if I was around. So I had to try something else. Good product I know other people whos dogs love it, mine did not."
3,"Nudity in the first 10 minutes. Plenty of killing, blood, torture, and miscellaneous violence. All the female actors are hot, buff and under 30 (and many naked). The male actors range from Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Mickey Rourke, & Bruce Willis to youngster in the Charlie Brown sweater, Elijah Wood.Definitely one of those movies for the boys that they'll all run out and add to their little DVD collections right alongside Star Wars, LOTR Trilogy, Constantine, Matrix, The Professional, Ronin, etc.The ""Marv"" character and storyline was the only reason I gave the movie 3 stars."
3,"As a devoted Martha Grimes fan, I can find something to like about every one of her books - with this one I relied on the tried and true characters of Jury, Plant, and Wiggins to pull me through the morass of plot twists, mediocre supporting characters, and the downright dismal portrayal of Baltimorians (can anyone possibly be that pathetic? I guess so.) One refreshing twist in this one - Richard Jury is nearly upbeat! It's often painful to follow him into the vat of depression that he absolutely must slog through in order to solve a case. Melrose is brilliant, as usual, and Wiggins is Wiggins. Gotta love him."
3,"Everyone loved the first seven books of this series. And yet, everyone thinks this is the worst yet. Lord of Chaos was my favorite, and it was the longest. A path of Daggers is half the size. What's up with that? When i go to buy a Robert Jordan book, especially one I just paid 20 odd dollars and waited two years for, I expect more. Where is the sense of accomplishment. No Forsaken even died, a staple of the last few books. Robert Jordan is almost backpedaling with all of these new Forsaken and a new Na'blis (excuse the spelling). Either that or he is really moving for an epic final book, with rand destroying numerous wielders of the power, cleansing saidin, and Destroying the Dark one. Maybe the next book will be Matt and Rand heavy, because one blows the horn of Valere and the other finally fights Tarmon Gaidin. Maybe Masema will be united with Rand and his rabble used as Trolloc fodder.God I hope so."
3,"Judging by their debut album, Muse are in love with their guitars. Which is no surprise seeing as their heroes are Radiohead and Nirvana. The songs on 'Showbiz' aren't tuneful in the pop-rock sense, but repeated listens show that these are songs of substance. I'd say 'Muscle Museum' is the most immediate of the tracks, while some of the songs aren't all that bad. Though they're not particularly outstanding either. Yeah, Matt Bellamy does sound like Thom Yorke, but there's still enough individuality is his style to distinguish himself and his band from their heroes. Other notable songs are 'Sunburn' and 'Filip'. If 'Showbiz' is a portent of what is to follow from Muse, then I'll certainly be one of those watching out for these lads."
3,"if you got this for free with a watch, it's a great deal. if you paid $45, well, you have a big, sturdy , yellow umbrella with the invicta logo all over it. if you don't like it, it would make a good gift for someone who doesnt mind a little product placement. it's not cheap-looking, and the shaped handle with ergonomic grip is a nice touch. i just wouldn't have paid $45 for it on its own. it's nice to have a big umbrella, though, all my other ones are super-cheap mini-compact ones. i'm hoping this stands up to the wind as well as keeps the rain off me. time will tell."
3,I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't say that it was one of my favorites but it was definitely worth reading. It was a little bland in places and could have used a little more creativity. All in all I would give the book three stars.
3,"I listened to this CD on a long drive in my rental car. I was so excited to get it because I loved her first CD so much, but I'm a bit disappointed. The songs, while well written, excude a sameness-Same chord, same key, same sound-all sung the same way. Same music, same drum beat, same bridge. It sounds like one really long song. I expected more from this CD. It's not a bad CD by any means, just not what I thought it would be. I'm glad to see Conya back and I hope to see her live soon!"
3,"Caught this group on DirectTV and was blown away by the live performance of this 24-member band. Unfortunately, the group is much better live than on this disc. If you like early 1970s prog-rock, you may be surprised that a young group is still doing that kind of music."
3,"My Braun 7505 works better on all of my body parts. I have no knicks, etc. with the Braun but I have had some problems with the norelco."
3,The book was good but if you love the movie you won't love the book... it is a love story but not from the same angle... I was disapointed in it.
3,The transfers are professional and good looking all the way. The selection of episodes is very good as well. My only beef that you should get more episodes for the money. These 12 episodes cost more than the whole 5th season of 'Make Room For Daddy' (6 Discs 33 episodes). Why not put 3 episodes of each show on? It would seem a better deal then and I'm sure I would have given 5 stars.
3,I used to take L-Carnitine but not Acetyl L-Carnitine and I don't know what is the difference between these two things.
3,"My daughter enjoys this toy a lot, and since I got it for a really good deal, it feels like it was worth the money. It is kind of flimsy, but it comes with lots of fun assesories, so theres plenty of things to do.I wish it was sturdier, but overall it's fun and cute."
3,I was expecting a bit more from this book. Im just a beginer but I already knew about the things he was talking about. Also his tips and tricks weren't all the greatest. There's better books with better prices that will give you better info than this book.
3,"Works perfect for my suzuki Z400, however it still sort of gets water in it. Would not buy another."
3,"I love the Stranglers first two albums - I grew up with them (Rattus and Heroes) in the late 70's and for me they were and still are great. However, like a lot of the 80's music, this one doesn't quite do it for me. But if you like the 80's music, you'll probably like this. Give a click on their No More Heroes and Rattus Norvegicus LP's if you want rock though."
3,"I played the demo of Draken and it was fun, so thats were i wanted this game. The game over all is fun but i did have truble near the begaining of the game in the ""showdow mire."" not a fun place to be. And there is Spiders! and i really don't like spiders but there is only 2 places i 100% know that there are spiders. Enoghf of that, i like dragons so thats fun riding on a dragon. the game is long, and the story line is good. But the ending could be better. the skill system is differnet because you can only have 12 skill point to put on your chariter so you can have a strong point and a weak point or you you can be balnced. Overall Draken is a O.K. game."
3,"I really like the Sesame Beginnings series, but this is not my favorite in the line. It just doesn't have much. I understand that it is for 0-6 months, but even at 3 months, my baby preferred the 6+ month books with real words and sentences(i.e. ""How Big is Baby Elmo?"")My son is uninterested until we get to the last page with the mirror, and even then, it makes him no more excited than our wall mirror...Overall, it's not a bad book, but it's just not as good as the others in the series."
3,"You'll either think this stuff is sick genius or really, really bad. I tend to go with the former, but they've done what they do better. ""It's Only Right and Natural"" is probably their best, so if you're new to the beautiful horror of the Frogs go there first. ""Bananimals"" has some fun stuff on it, but really doesn't live up to what they did on ""Natural"" or even ""My Daughter the Broad."" Wish they'd focus their lyrics more, though. The Frogs occasionally have the problem of songs not matching up to their titles."
3,There no denying the presence of the singer and the lyrics are great. But it also sounds like the band is not quite up to the task of doing something interesting with the singing and lyrics. It all just misses. The drummer is especially banal but the guitar-work isn't much better.
3,"This watch is the best looking digital watch I've been able to find in years. Its real metal case is so much nicer than the plastic cases found on most digitals. I've been using a Timex digital with much more functionality. I miss the countdown timer and the ability to use the Indiglo light in the stop-watch mode. I also miss the ability to turn off the hourly chime. Reading the functional description before ordereing, it was not clear to me how limited the functions of this watch were. So, I'm disaponted by the limited functionality, but delighted in the appearance."
3,"The built-in 32mb with the psa(play)60 gets you about 25 minutes worth of music(not the 60 minutes that is advertised) if you have decent quality mp3s. The sound quality is great and I have yet to hear the device skip. The only drawback is that most people do not realize that you need to download firmware from riohome.com so that you can have the choice of internal and external storage. This piece of information is not on the cd that comes with the device when you load Audio Manager. After visiting a newsgroup, I found out about the firmware and have been able to download to the 32mb MMC card I purchased for the device. I have no complaints with the sound, just with all the grief that went into getting 45 minutes worth of music."
3,there is a track or song that doesnt exist in this soundtrack but it's found in the movie when paul walker helps vin diesel and get away from cops and then paul is invited at vin's house..so the music starts the moment they enter the house and walk the stairs and when vin's sister notice paul walker and started to change her clothes.. and the best part of this music is when the ex bf of mia is playing with the guitar and paul walker drinks beer and stares at mia's ex.. so pls ladies and gentlemen what's the name of this song (name and artist) coz it turns me onn.
3,"Robert DeNiro is usually a mean, foul mouthed mobster. But in this movie he stars as a more Woody Allen type, it really shows DeNiro's acting skill, which we usually overlook because he usually plays a mobster in every movie. Anyway, Robert DeNiro stars as a man who is obsessed with late night TV host, played by Jerry Lewis. DeNiro, by chance, gets to have a little chit chat. Lewis, just wanting him to get away, promises him a spot on his show and blah, blah, blah. DeNiro, ecstatic with joy, thinks he's for real. When DeNiro finds out he wasn't for real, he takes action...and...it's...slightly humorous. Funny at some points, but all in all a nice flick. Directed by Martin Scorcese, and Sandra Bernhard also stars in the film, very annoyingly though."
3,Love this watch. Looks very classy. Very disappointed when I had the watch band sized. The band is very stiff. The watch looks like it has a bangle band and is a little difficult to put on.
3,I thought this would be a learning experience for my 8 year old. Instead it was frustrating and boring. The snap together planets did not work very well. The instructions were not clear. There was not explaination of how the planets should line up. Too much guess work.
3,"hey, I don't own this model, but I have a little Kodak Winner 110 camrea, and I just recently bought a Bell & Howell 35mm. I finally dug out my 110 and bought the first rolls of film for it in years. even though the film is kinda hard to find sometimes, and the picture quility isn't as good as the 400 speed Kodak film I shoot in my 35mm, it's still alot of fun to play with during good sunny days, mainly cause I'm too cheap to look for flash bars for it.I'm hoping someday to buy a Nikon but one can only wish at the moment."
3,"First off, I must say that I love Vegas. It is on my top ten list of cd's of all time. I still listen to the whole thing all the way through quite often. It has been four years since CM made an album, and I was excited for Tweekend. And to be honest, I am disappointed. Is the music bad? No. But its pop/rock/hardcorish stuff, not as much break beat as Vegas. That may be fine for some people, but I really just wanted more of the same as Vegas. With few exceptions, you won't find that here. Again, it is an decent cd, but not what i was hoping for."
3,"After searching through 1800 applicants, Lou Pearlman picked the best 5. Then why isn't the CD better? It isn't because these guys aren't trying. The weakness of this group, as see it, is that so many factors (looks, dancing ability, ethnic mix) went into the selection that they ended up with a group where all are merely average singers. Secondly, the only stand-out song is ""Baby I Would"" which has been overexposed. ""Love Should Be A Crime,"" ""Shy Girl"" and several others are serviceable, but nothing that really grabs you. I would think Pearlman could afford better quality material, but then the members' vocal limitations have to be considered. I do think O-Town has potential to grow and develop, and there's no doubt that Jacob Underwood has a great deal of talent. This CD definitely makes me appreciate NSync's first and also BSB's first American CD. They are essential pop albums. This isn't. But...it's a start."
3,"Not exactly what I would call the best of Michael Ball, but overall the album was satisfactory."
3,"This is the first book that I bought to give me an idea of what to expect during my first pregnancy. While the overall layout leaves something to be desired (it appears monthly, but then other information is spread throughout), and the tone may be somewhat alarmist, I found that it gave me the general information that I needed. I knew almost nothing about what to expect and would rather be extra cautious my first pregnancy than to do a big no-no because of ignorance.I woudl recommend this book to someone who needs the general information, but also has enough common sense to adapt some of it's guidelines to their own lifestyle (for example, one soda is not a good drink choice in this book, but if you like soda and would feel comfortable drinking one every other day or even every day, making sure to intake enough water etc, then go ahead and do it!)."
3,"We love the GeoTrax system. My son got it for Christmas 2 years ago when he was 3, and he still plays with it fairly frequently.The Mile High Mountain is the least-used of all our GeoTrax pieces. It is too hard for him to set up alone. Sometimes even I have trouble remembering exactly how to configure it. Once it's set up it, it works very well and is a lot of fun. If we had lots of room to leave the GeoTrax set up all the time, we would LOVE the moutain. But we keep our GeoTrax in several huge tubs, and build new layouts all the time. The mountain adds frustration and delays to the building process. It also takes up a LOT of room in the huge storage tubs, that could be better spent on a zillion more track pieces. (Son likes to make really long tracks and ""deliver"" stuff from one room to another.)"
3,"Did anyone read the warning on the label of this item?? It states that the state of California has declared this item harmful, may cause cancer, etc.???"
3,"If you're searching for intricacies, tricky guitar solos, pretty melodies, this album is not for you. If you wanna listen Zakk plays with anger and uncommon aggression, this is the album for you. STRONGER THATN DEATH is HEAVIER THAN DEATH!! The album is difficult to diggest in the beginning, it's almost industrial at some moments, Zakk's vocals are not the best role model for an aspiring lead singer....But, once you forget theses flaws, you will enjoy the sheer weight of this record. Amazaing stuff."
3,"I am in the minority group - I think it us terrible that this English soap opera was developed and only 10 parts were made. I invested hours in watching great acting, great costumes and excellent scenery only to side-swipped and robbed by the abrupt ending! As much as I enjoyed the 10 acts, I just feel like I would have been better off not watching it because of how it ended. Save your time and find something that will not keep you guessing!"
3,"My daughter played with this lightly for two days and loved it. Then a small plastic peg snapped off, leaving the toy useless."
3,not sure if I bought these particlar ones. mine were not new perhaps refurbished maybe even a knock off. It was a $13 special. Had an issue with the cyan not working well and it took several cleaning passes to have it come out of it. It has been working well enough since. It was cheap enough and worked well enough for me but not 5 star good
3,"Title says it all. Dish itself hold up well in micro and freezer, but the cover doesn't really seal shut. It just sits on the lips of the container. Not very secure for storage purposes."
3,"This item includes all the pieces you should need to do a nice job. I think it fails making the high mark because it offers a dvd with it but the dvd doesn't work. That leaves no written instructions or working dvd to guide you through the use of the product, making the use a bit scary considering it will be used on a dearly loved pet that doesn't need to be scared by your lack of education."
3,"This movie was almost clever, almost witty and almost cool. The biggest absence was the lack of interesting and engrossing characters. Entertaining but not satisfying. However, it does have a very cool opening scene."
3,"The engineering of this is a little sub par. The back panel barely fits on. The nails have to be angled just to make it fit. It is designed heavier, with oversized pieces where not necessary. I will say that at least it is mainly made up of true plywood and solid wood, not particleboard or fiberboard. I bought two the same, so I know that one was just not a manufacturing defect. For the price, the quality of design should have been higher, but it wasn't. The packaging is not good either. The corner of the box was crumpled, so a corner of one the pieces (the top) was also slightly crumpled."
3,"I bought this coffee after reading the reviews. I was disappointed. EVERYONE seemed to think this coffee was wonderful. I certainly would not rate it bad, but OK--not exactly what I was anticipating.UPDATE: I received an e-mail from the president of Hawaiian Roasters, the company that makes this coffee. Since I was not totally satisfied with the coffee, I was given a full refund. While this coffee is not my favorite, I will say the company makes a great effort to satisfy the customer. Thank you, Mr. Krant."
3,"I bought this book from guitar center, mainly because I love Ozzy Osbourne & Randy Rhoads, and am constantly searching online for 100% correct tabs for alot of the songs and have found many, many, many just plain wrong ones.Well, as another reviewer mentioned...this book is wrong.Its advertised as 100% correct transcriptions from the albums, and thats not what is in print.Alot of these are close, and the solos are usually 100% right, but most of the rhythem sections are seriously wrong.It looks like some of Randys moves werent figured out and random notes were thrown in place of a proper chord or etc.Its funny because I can take the tab and put it into guitar-pro on the computer (it plays tabs as typed in) and sync up the actuall song, and parts of the song will be missed, wrong, etc..When you hear a chord, and the tab shows a sequence of 9-9-9-9-9 notes in place, you know somethings up.this book isnt 100% right, and if thats what you want, try a different tab book."
3,"Let me tell you where the plot goes wrong. About 15 minutes into the movie, Tom Cruise gets into Jamie Foxx's cab randomly. So what you ask? The entire premise of the movie revolves around Cruise's character Vincent getting into Foxx's cab. Which is what makes it such a distraction. WHY would a hit-man use a cab when he could easily have rented a car? Or stolen a car? Foxx's character Max asks ""why my cab"" instead of the more pressing question: ""why any cab?""Cruise plays Cruise, and this film looks too much like ""Ali"", another Mann flick.Otherwise, Jamie Foxx is great and the film is entertaining. I recommend you fast-forward through the part where Cruise gets in the cab and invent your own story to explain what the writer and director didn't."
3,"This paperback blank journal has a simple painting on the cover of an ideal reading and thinking spot - a comfortable chair, good books and a window to the outside world. The pages within are smooth, fresh, white and ideal for the flow of thought to pen. The book is light and contains no quotes etc... I gave several to friends to record the books they've read over the years."
3,history of the world is the basis for many many pop culture jokes... absolutely hilarious. only disappointment was the mono audio track.
3,"Why are Bob Dylan covers often so oversung, overplayed, and overpolished? The one exception is original backup singer Regina McCrary. 3 stars only because these songs deserved acknowledgement and the commentary was basically ok."
3,"My five year old (big Scooby-Doo fan) worked his way through the game very quickly. The package states that it's different each time the game is played. However, the variations in each new game tended to be minimal, with a finite number of suspects and the clues are always in the same place, regardless of what level is played. So once you've played the game once, and know where the clues are, there's no mystery the next time you play. Only the villain's identity changes between one of the five suspects."
3,"It's all the friends we know and love but the quality of certain scenes of this DVD are grainy and lacking. My 2 yr old doesn't mind of course. Don't expect much Elmo, mainly Big Bird and every other character."
3,My first Bluetooth headset and I was a little disappointed.Pros:Good volumeEasy to useCons:2-3 second delay when I speak (BIG CON)Echo - I can hear what I say after I say itInteresting is that it works better (less of a delay/echo)on my iphone than my blackberry BOLD. Seems the phone makes some difference.
3,"This is not Pratchett at his best. Written many years before the Disc World Series (which are all 5 stars), it just doesn't showcase unique style in a positive light. The ending was unsatisfying. It felt like he got tired of writing the story part way through. It was all very formulaic."
3,"Jose Yglesias, an American novelist, journalist, and playwright of Spanish and Cuban descent, died in New York City in 1995. His best work was A Wake in Ybor City. This book in my view takes a too whimsical look at life in Castro's Cuba but still enjoyable to read"
3,"I love the idea of this book. After some introductory stuff (which is quite good), Ricklef gives a series of readings for characters from history, myth, and ""familiar"" stories. I put quotations around familiar because I was not familiar with about a third of the stories. Ricklef relies heavily on Greek myth and Shakespeare for inspiration. For someone with a more classical education this would probably be great, but I majored in physics and managed to get by reading only 2 Shakespeare plays in my life (neither of which were in this book). Of the Greek myths, I knew about half of them.I throughly enjoyed the readings done for charaters I did know, such as the Ugly Duckling, Belle from the Beauty and the Beast, and Einstein. Also, the card descriptions in the back, which seem almost as an afterthought, are very good. Ricklef gives some relevant life advice after each card. Quite inspiring!"
3,"After seeing the excellent 8-hour version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" this version of ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" seemed to hurry through some of the most memorable parts of Dickens's book, such as Martin's and Mark's time in America. I don't feel that most of the main characters were given time to develop, either, and Martin Sr. didn't seem sufficiently curmudgeonly. However, Jonas and Mr. Pecksniff were acted superbly, and overall I enjoyed the film."
3,"If only you were lonely is definitely different from Silence in Black and White. It's a lot softer, more mainstream sounding. They threw all of the screaming parts at the end of the songs, whereas in Silence in Black and White it was mixed throughout the whole song. If you wanted Hawthorne Heights to go more ""hardcore"", this CD is definitely not for you. The vocals are good, but a lot of the songs sound alike. All in all, I think they could have done better."
3,"The CD contains some good songs, my favorite's being ""Adam's song"" and ""All the good things"", but some of them are a bit too much: too loud, too noisy, too punk, too hard. The songs contain explicit lyrics, so they should not be played around children. It's mostly not good background music so you won't be able to play it when you have guests, unless they are there for your 16th birthday party. Not many will be able to play this CD in the car and drive without having accidents, LOL, some songs are very hard rock and therefore could be very distracting while driving.That said, some songs are actually good and you'll be able to listen to them with someone who is not into rock, but some of them will make any chillout fan flee. The band does write the texts and plays the music, which is not true of many young bands nowadays. So they deserve 3 stars."
3,"I like this mouse and the way it feels and works except that this is now the third one I have owned and all three have had problems with the track wheel going out and not scrolling. Just purchased the magic mouse and have been more happy with it up to this point. I didn't think I would like the feel of the slimmer design but so far, the magic mouse way out does the mighty mouse with one exception. It does not have the double buttons on the side."
3,"This cd I got because I knew Johnnette Napolitano was from Concrete Blonde and was curious about it. I don't know too much about Holly Vincent except that she sang with The Italians and The Oblivious. So, if your familiar with Concrete Blonde I can say this is similiar, just not as produced and a bit more raw, punk, indie. Anyway, I really like this. Alot of the songs are simple and catchy, so I got to know them pretty quick. You may also want to check out her other cd release from 1995, ""Pretty and Twisted"". It's a bit more like CB than this. I think both discs are out of print, so good luck."
3,"I finished this book 2 days ago after letting it sit in my library for nearly 3 years. I have to say that I find the book uncompelling and simple. I mean, with the word ""simple"", that the charecters have no depth at all, when the author needs a person, boom, he/she's there.What disappointed me most was the dragon Cobalt. I understand that dragons can be fond of their riders (and don'T get me wrong I've been reading DL for quite some time now) but this one is just childish. Almost as if he's a pet. He is lacking depth as well. The main plot of the book is unclear until the last 60 or so pages. The reader has no idea what the book's all about.But, the book takes hold of the reader now and then. Some parts of the book is definitely exiciting but all in all not a very good effort on Herbert's part."
3,"I'm 23 (as of this review) and I am lucky to have heard of Firesign Theatre at all. This album is the first I have purchased and it almost made me never want to hear so much as the troupe's name again. The first half of this album is a stream-of-conciousness string of annoying sounds and voices that never seem to have any coherent point to get across. It is drawn out, confusing, irritating and painfully, horrifically unfunny.The second half is the only reason to get this CD and the only reason I didn't chuck it out the window of a moving train. The Nick Danger piece is very funny and entertaining. The Naked Gun meets Monty Python sketch works very well with some hilarious wordplay, one-liners and random silliness (""Nick! Nick! Wake up! And stop hitting me!""). It is the album's saving grace and the one thing that made me want to pursue more of Firesign's material."
3,"jay-z is apealing to a lot of musical taste. will be very popular because it is pop music. not great for one of the 3 best MC's ever (biggie, jay-z and nas). if you liked best of both worlds you will like this album. great production if you like r&b mixed with hip hop. couple of songs he flows to his potential. MOP comes off. lots of club bangers. lots of videos will come from this. very little grime. not for wu-tang / mob deep / lox fans. dre/rakim/jay song is very good."
3,"As an avid tennis player and reader, I am always looking to for good books on tennis. This book is a compilation of previous interviews and past stories. Many of these are excellent. There is quite a bit of past champions pre-dating my life that were informative. But after initially enjoying the stories, eventually they weaken and become repetitive. I believe this book should be about 2/3 the size it currently is. It is rare I struggle on a subject in which I have great interest. So, while most reviews are quite glowing, just be advised that in my opinion the book is uneven in content and tends to ramble."
3,"I bought the dish for the holidays to serve multiple vegetables, but the compartments were too small. The dish is also alittle heavier than I like. I kept it & will probably use it for nuts or such. The design is nice."
3,"An interesting, reasonably credible, well filmed sequence of events in a movie occasionally hinting at greater depths which are, unfortunately, left unplumbed."
3,I really enjoyed Tuesday's with Morrie so i decided to read this book. While it was a good book it was nothing compared to Tuesday's with Morrie
3,"Like everyone, I love Band of Brothers and had high expectations for this series. Perhaps too high. The first four episodes are very slow, leaving me wondering if the Marines faced any combat at all during this campaign. Finally, the story begins to concentrate on the trials and tribulations of the war itself, rather than hours of back story that leave us feeling no closer to the characters than when we started.My advice: if you feel bored and disappointed in the first two discs, stick with it. It gets better."
3,"I agree that the product is good. It absorbs quickly and there is no stickiness. I've only been using Progesterone for 2 weeks now and the past few nights I've been sleeping better than I have in a long time, when this close to my period. My true rating is 3.5 stars. My complaint (and it feels like a big one to me) is that one full pump is a heaping 1/2 teaspoon (I measured it). If you ever try to rub that much lotion into your body all the once, you'll see that it's a lot, especially out of a shower on a cold morning & the cream feels cold on the skin. I did some math and figured that it has approx. 175mg of progesterone per oz. Most creams have 450mg, reason why you have to use so much. It's concetration is too low. I'm going to try Progesta-Eze (bummer that Amazon doesn't have it), but I might be back to BioEntopic."
3,"I have not finished reading yet but,it is an interesting 'read'..The author has done much research and appears to know & understand the 'subject matter'. I'm sorry, I find it difficult to BELIEVE so many people would fall for his 'gosple' and accept it as truth."
3,"i'm not an audiophile, but these sound good to me. the only complaint would be the length of the cord (way too long) and the ear buds are connected in a J-shape. that means one side is longer than the other. if u don't mind (i thought i didn't, but eventually did), then i guess it would be ok."
3,"All your favorite action stars in one flick! Even Chuck Norris makes a cameo. If you liked the 1st Expendables you will like this movie. Explosions, fight scenes...just a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously."
3,If you haven't read the book you will want to after seeing this film. This movie is like a made for tV drama. The second part is better more like a major motion picture.
3,"I enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' other two novels very much. This book was very good, but you really need to have a positive outlook on life to read this. The first part of the book was like any other typical love story. In the middle of the book, you are brought into the present of the main characters in their seventies and eighties. the rest of the book drags a bit, and focuses too much on the feebleness of the two main characters. This is the part where you will need the whole box of kleenex. The end of the book made me feel happy for the main characters, but depressed about my own impending aging process and where it will someday lead. Believe me, you will feel like you need a prosac for the rest of the day. If Sparks focused a little less on the detailed aging process of the characters, I think this book could have been as much of a romantic heart-warming love story as his other two books."
3,Arrived in GREAT condition & the movie was good to see again after not seeing it since 1961 when I was 9 years old!!!
3,THOUGHT THE MOVIE DRAGGED OUT MOST OF THE TIME......ONLY ACTION WAS A FEW MINUTES AT THE END.......I DID NOT HATE IT... BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN.....IT'S A MOVIE TO WATCH WHEN NOTHING ELSE IS ON....
3,not the color they advertise it to be. It is a little more on the green side than the picture shows.
3,The book was interesting for the most part. I could not agree with the conclusion as it sounded to sci-fi with no real evidence to support their assumptions.
3,"I love the Sears and have read almost all of their works. However, I have to say that I can't stand the way they treat handling a fussy baby. They didn't have a fussy baby until their fourth child. As a first time mother, I just don't like the way they seem to act like having a fussy baby is no big deal and that I'm doing something wrong when I can't figure out what is wrong and get frustrated. None of the advice that they have offered so far has worked for us.I just don't think that this book is useful for first time parents with a high-needs baby. All my friends in the same situation agree.I just don't think that they can empathize with someone who has never had to handle a baby at all before and then suddenly has a high-needs baby.I love all of their other works and highly recommend them and perhaps for someone who has already had children, this may be useful. But for first-time parents, I advise you look elsewhere."
3,"It seems to be little difficult, but doable. I tried it and it was okay. I guess it is mostly for intermediate to advanced level. Beginners may have a difficult time. You should try it even if you end up doing 2 or 5 minutes of it."
3,"192 pages hardly allows the author room to expound on Hepburn's real life. I felt that I got a good overview of her, but would like to more about her-- especially what it was like to work with her on various movies. This is a good introductory biography, but I want more."
3,"I read this book over the course of spring break, which included a 2 23-hour drives, so I had a lot of down time. This book was great entertainment for that kind of situation; however, I couldn't help but want more from the book. The author is obviously witty and she has a wonderful plot with which to work. Yet, I didn't feel like the book ultimately delivered. The internal explanations for the characters' behavior didn't always jive to me, and there were times when I thought the book lost all common sense. Bottom line: a great beach read but it could be much better."
3,"This jewelry cleaner works, but it may take a lot of work. You have rub every piece and crevice in order to make it shine. I've used plenty of other cleaners in the past where merely soaking the jewelry will get it clean and sparkling. So if you don't mind the work, then buy it. However, if you expect to soak it and be done this is not the product for you."
3,"I am a big fan of Makita tools. I have many Makita 18v tools and I love them. However, this is a lightweight, made in China, plastic flashlight. The rear on/off push-button is a poor design. Should have a front trigger switch which is much easier to use with one hand. I like the click-stop head positions. However, there are no other special features. This product should sell for $12..00 to $15.00."
3,"I think ""Absolutely American"" could have been so much more, but fell short. I am so glad that David Lipsky recorded the stories of the cadets, West Point History, and the instructors for all of us to read. Unfortunately, Lipsky's writing style is disjointed and detracts from the compelling stories. His chapters jump back and forth, and try to cover the experiences of too many cadets at once. I wish that Lipsky had stuck with a few key cadets, and not inserted so many other anecdotes because it made his work difficult to follow. I can't exactly pinpoint why Lipsky's writing style falls short of paying the stories justice--perhaps it's almost to MTVish (i.e jumping back and forth.) However, I believe that David Lipsky does give the public a better, clearer idea of what it means to be a cadet at West Point. It's worth the read for the substance, but certainly not the style.My favorite story was of Don ""Whitey"" Herzog and his career choices."
3,"Buy this movie if you love vintage racing action. Because there is not much else to the movie, no real plot line or character development."
3,"i guess this soundtrack has got to be my favorite out of all of them, because it is the only one that has at least 4 songs that i like. the rest are ok."
3,"This is a good stand for the price. Easy to assemble. Unfortunately they shipped it in the retail box without any additional packaging. It arrived bent, but functional. Maybe I should have sent it back, but I didn't want to take the time since it was still usable."
3,"Good things about this vacuum:it has a very long cordit is quite powerfulit is not hard to empty and does not require bagsBad things:It is quite heavythe exhaust, as other reviewers have commented, tends to blow the dirt around the back of the appliance"
3,This is a nice cable with dual ears to protect the tabs from breaking. They work like they should which is good. They are a little pricey for what they are. Also note that the color is not the same as in the picture. These are light gray in color not Dark Gray.
3,"Because the Gospels, contrary to all that is generally accepted, do not give us a report on Jesus Messiah, Son of God, as seems reported by independent eyewitnesses (Mark, Matthew and Luke). They offer us an account of community conflicts, recorded at successive phases of community evolution, (from open quarrels to the healing process) explaining the baffling discrepancies between evangelists. In doing so, the evangelists used a language familiar to the Essene. Jesus Messiah, as were the previous tandem Essene Messiahs, was initially coined as a party label. Both Gospel Messiahs (Jesus and John the Baptist) were there to allow the writers record their dissents and deliberations. Both Gospel Messiahs were just as today the donkey versus the elephant arguing within the same American democracy. Tell me which Messiah you support, and I'll tell you exactly where to position you within the Essene community while turning painfully into a Christian community in Antiochus."
3,"Mosse gives us here a collection of essays published in different journals and over a period of years, yet they are all distinguished by a search for fresh insights into the still-relevant phenomenon of fascism (as with the recent upsurge of the Nationalist Right in several European countries). There are some errors (Brasillach was never married and some historical sequences are unaccountably off), but the small volume is well worth exploring."
3,"The idea of the system and the quality of the belts are great. I love the hands free ability and there's room on the belt for a treat pouch. The positioning of the connections are also very convenient and the idea of being able to latch the other end of the leash to the belt so it doesn't drag if the dog is off leash is very helpful. The hooks work well but the positions that the user sets the size of the waist belt and the length of the leash don't hold well; they need locked in some way so that they don't get bigger or longer during use. I am training my pup but she is not really a puller; however as we walk the waist belt sags on me and if she does put any pressure on the leash it lengthens causing me to have to hold the leash anyway! I only gave it three stars because with the price of The Buddy System, I think that two locking adjusters for sizing could be expected (one on the waist belt and one on the leash)."
3,"This tape has two workouts based on Latin dance styles. It is not hard to pick up the steps. This is a good workout for days when you're not interested in doing more traditional exercises. The male dance instructor has a great smile, and is not bad to look at at! Ms. Smith is her usual upbeat self."
3,I was not knowledgeable about the magnification of a binocular. Brought it anyways as a beginner. Magnifies objects well within say half a mile.
3,"This audio is very abridged. Many key scenes were left out. The section where Laurent tells Beauty about serving Lady Elveria is completely left out, and Lexius is left in the garden when Tristan and Laurent are taken to the ship by Nicholas and the Captian."
3,"This 1st book for Goodkind in his SoT series is one of his best. Sadly I recommend NOT reading it since as a series SoT leaves much to be desired.The series deteriorates into cardboard cut out characters with wooden dialogs coupled with inane plots all while punishing the reader with philosophy 101 preached at a grade school level.In short, run (don't walk) away from this series!If however you don't mind reading a couple books and never finishing a series than by all means read Wizards 1st."
3,"Cute graphics, some historical inaccuracies (e.g. saxons dressed like romans wielding celtic shields and fighting like roman legions). Game play is simply too hard for 1 player as you reach higher levels, feels more like gang rape then video game (you're the one on the wrong end),Want to experience saxon gang-rape? Play this game."
3,"I will admit that I don't do that much archery, but when I have used this armguard, it feels somewhat flimsy and isn't the most comfortable. So, if you just want a bottom-dollar product that gets the job done but isn't necessarily very comfortable, than this will be fine. I'd suggest it to beginners and people like me who are fickle about hobbies and won't necessarily use it all the time."
3,"I bought this cd after listening to Kenny Burrell and John Coltrane (which is phenomenal). It has its moments, but is not a great cd. Burrell's playing is ok, but with the horns in the rhythm section, it;s just hard for me to listen. There are many great Burrell albums out there; this isn't one of them"
3,Good way to waste an hour and a half. The ending was disappointing and the entire movie had no depth.
3,I thought the stencils were going to be a little more graphic than they were. They were sloppy looking and all looked like a kids doodling book
3,"Well im stuck with this item. It is consider hazardous and you can't return it. All it is, is wire though. Not sure why its considered hazardous. My winch is placed at the front of vehicle and I don't put it on take it off etc."
3,"As a Metallica fan, when I first listened to this CD, I was dissappointed. It just wasn't Metallica. After giving it another listen I'm starting to respect it. If you're looking for Kirk Hammett's kick-arse solos, or in fact any solos, don't buy this album. If you're into thrash metal and heavy guitars, or you're just a die-hard Metallica fan, this album is for you."
3,"Let me start by saying I love to read her books. Some of them I have read over and over again, however, this one here, not up to her normal standard. The characters seem plastic, cookie cutter, nothing interesting or worth reading. It is a shame. I pray this book is not the new standard from Ms. Roberts."
3,"This is a solid piece of hard rock, with strong musicians and good production. But some of the songs are simply weak, and nou amount of musicianship can save them. Anyway, it's an enjoyable album, even if you've never heard about KISS. Ace can live without his pals; the problemis that he's too lazy to record albums. TROUBLE WALKIN was his LAST solo effort, and it was released in 1991..."
3,I got this for my 4 year old son for Easter after reading the great reviews. It is a fun toy and my son enjoyed it at first. After 2 days of use all of the rockets were broken even an extra set that I had purchased with it. The launcher seems fairly durable and easy to use but the rockets need some help.
3,"The glasses are smaller than I thought. The smaller size dishes are the size you put a coffee cup on, which did not make sense because they did not come with coffee cups, and I didn't need any more cups, so I thought they would naturally come with the medium size plates!Once opening this item there is no going back. Very hard to open and would be very hard to return!!"
3,Pen works well enough. Really liked the old BD pen which was discontinued. This pen is not at sturdy. But works well enough.
3,"This is a solid board, and easy to keep sanitary. But the rubber corners are of a hard compound that does not grip my Formica(tm) countertops well- so it still slides. I'm back to putting a damp towel under it like I did with my plain poly cutting board."
3,"Quiet Man is one of my all time favorites, but the DVD version left alot to be desired. The film quality is closer to VHS, if even that good. The only 'feature' was a ""The Making of..."" special, which is also available on the VHS version.A great film, but a very disappointing DVD entry."
3,"Raise your hands - how many people see Jimmy Stewart when you hear the name Lindbergh?Yet, we'd have a hard time seeing Jimmy embracing Hitler, which Lucky Lindy did. There's a brand now book out now exploring an ""alternate universe"" scenario where Lindbergh is president. One hypothetical outcome of President Linbergh is pogroms in the United States. Makes McCartyism seem like getting off easy...This book dwells on the heroic aspects of Lindy without dishing up the forces which would draw this ""simple country boy"" into a belief that fascism would save the world. It cannot be just the ""law and order"" mentality delivered by the horrendous kidnapping of his baby, which seems to be suggested here.Nonetheless, read this book before you read the new one on ""President Lindberg."" Real history is sometimes more challenging but more fun that the fictional stuff, and this book is straight facts."
3,"i had another adapter that worked flawlessly, but when it broke i bought this one. Although it looked the same size it was slightly too big for the audio jack on the back of my Intel iMac. I'm sure it works great, but it didn't work for me."
3,I have to agree with some of the other reviewer comments regarding the decline in quality for Levi jeans. The material seems a lot thinner than the last pair of jeans I purchased. Besides the flimsy material the jeans didn't fit well either. I have worn the same size jeans for the past several years. I would swear the pair I just purchased on Amazon was at least a size too big. I ended up buying the size pair of Lee jeans on Amazon and they fit just right and the quality of material was a lot better. Lee jeans has a new customer.
3,"Just came across this set here, and I must say that the Oscar Shumsky recordings of the Mozart concertos seem quite out of place, or sync with this set. Most of it is taken up with performances of the Hanover Band, a very sqwacky outfit. I love Shumsky's performances of these concertos, and both the original lp of the recording and the eventual CD, both of which I have, had a sweet picture of him on the cover looking very fondly avuncular. But his style was old style, meaning great musicianship with no gimmicks. Though Anthoy Halstead did have some good moments inexplicably with the Hanover squallers, the performances with Goodman were all very coarse. But even the good moments were nothing near the sublime Oscar Shumsky. Really out of place in this crowd."
3,"This movie was average, so I gave it three stars. I absolutely loved Tenchi Muyo!, Tenchi Universe and the first movie. Tenchi Forever, on the other hand, disappointed me. I felt this movie was a little boring, predictable and nothing new to the Tenchi community. And you should really follow the R rating...."
3,of all the pink panther movies this is my least favorite. i like comedies but although i was amused here and there i seldom laughed. if it had not been for herbert loms predictable reaction to sellers character i would not have laughed at all.
3,"I purchased these vitamins from entirely pets but I had used them previously from a local feed store. The vitamins are excellent but when I received this bottle the box, bottle and contents smelled highly of pesticides (just like roach spray). My dog wouldn't touch the vitamins in this bottle and she normally eats them with no problem. I won't purchase anything from entirely pets again. Find this Vitamin from another seller."
3,"I liked the first half a lot, but I got bored with the characters by the end of the book. John Irving goes off on tangents and that is part of his charm. I can't explain why the first half of the book was so good, but I later lost interest."
3,"Very good image quality and superb sound. Lots of trains. Lots of trains. Lots of same trains. Watching trains nowadays is a redunctant parade of same type locomotives, same color, same container or coal loaded cars in endlesses strings. I like trains, of course, but this DVD is a little, let's say, boring. That's why I gave it 2 and 1/2 stars."
3,"It was okay, didn't think it was that challenging and I ended up getting bored 3/4 into it and just couldn't continue. It's not the length of the video, I'm used to practicing for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, but possibly the way it is sequenced. I think I'll give it a second chance, using the matrix system to better set up the different sections. FYI, I used Play All originally and the stretchy, calming poses were right at the 3/4 mark and then transitioned into inversions and so on."
3,"The problem that I had with them was that when I installed the drivers, everything would work fine except the Multi Function Display that displays the date and time, this is a must if you fly IFR. Needless to say that the time and date would not change. I figured that it was probably the joystick so I got another one, it did the same thing. After several attempts with Tech Support they finally decided that I should send them back to them, this was on December 14th when I shipped them Fedex. As of January 9, 2007 I am still waiting for something to come back to me. They are extremely slow to respond. I am sure that they will find nothing with the joystick and I will be stuck with something that has issues. Buyer Beware!!!"
3,"As everyone else mentioned, this product doesn't actually have the LED's as shown. I figured that before I ordered, so no big deal.It also arrived with the power supply casing dented at the top and bottom on one side, as though it was dropped on its side The box it was shipped in was pristine which leads me to believe it was dented when it was packed (or before), not damaged during transit.But it works, it's quiet, and I need my PC now, so as a lazy passive-aggressive consumer I'm just going to keep it and gripe a little about the dents.*Updated 4/6/2009 - can't reboot my PC anymore, the power supply is making lots of noise and just isn't delivering enough juice to run the PC anymore.It gets to the stage where it scans for drives and freezes - which is the same problem I had when I replaced the original supply with this one...going to try a different brand, and one with more watts."
3,"I've read the entire series to date. LaHaye and Jenkins have made Revelation much clearer: as a Christian who tends to put off until tomorrow what I should be doing today, I've found the series has really brought the concept of now, not later, into focus. However, Apollyon seemed unnecessary, at least as an entire book. Its content could have been boiled down into 1/2 the number of pages and included in the next one. I question why the authors wrote a book that dragged so, wasted so much time on Hattie's health, etc. Did they feel they had to get out another in the series to keep their publishers and public satisfied? If so, this one didn't make the cut. Generally not up to their usual best! If I were a reader picking up this book first instead of Left Behind, I probably wouldn't buy the rest of the series."
3,"These are good straws, about 1/2 inch diameter and about 7.5 inch in length. The ones I received were hot purple in color, which is really not the color I would have chosen. I think 8 or 9 inch straws might be more useful if you intend to drink a smoothy directly out of the blender. And it would probably have been nice if the straw is somewhat translucent, which was not the case for the ones I received. That would be my next plan. But either way these straws are sturdy, and I often wash them by hand with cold water, soap, and a long wooden chop-stick to rub the inside clean. I do not put these straws in the dishwasher because the heat and the harsh detergents can release plasticizers from the plastic -- which would probably be unhealthy-- that is my guess. Because some plasticizers have the effect of feminine hormones (such as estrogen) on our tissues. I like these fat straws because I can use them to get my yogurt fix while I am driving to work. Good enough for me."
3,"The opening was too large at the back, so I had to add velcro closures. Also the fins are the same material as the gloves, which I didn't realize. It makes them ""floppy"". I thought they were plastic. Additionally, the fingertips started to have pieces of the material flake off after just one evening of normal use.After the adjustments they looked alright, but functionally they're kind-of a bust. Thanks for reading."
3,"I haven't had these in awhile, but I grew up on them!Since the weather had been a bit too cold for me to goout, I needed a little something extra to put me overthe $25 total that was needed for FREE Shipping, andthanks to Amazon's Add-On Program, I got Goetze'sCaramel Creams! These were my favorite candy as achild, and I was happy to find them here on Amazon.The only negative comments I will leave is that theweight of the package was NOT large enough to equalONE POUND and the product was STALE ... The Sellerwas NOT happy with my 3-Star Review. I was being100% honest and saw no valid reason to change it.(The Customer is NOT always right with this Seller)"
3,"Lucas had done a pretty good job at this film. Star Wars films had always hailed in visual effects, and they ae so awesome in this film. THe battle scenes are so spectacular and mind blowing. There's no ... Jake Lloyd (THANK GOD) in this film, but a bit of Jar Jar ... . The plot a decent, a fits in with the other Star Wars episodes. Yoda was abit crazy and unatural, but oh well. Love story was not very good. Dialogue was bad.They shouldn't have brattish teenagers in this film. I especially hate the part when Anakin says that he hate obi wna, and that he thinks thatobi wan is jealous about him, and Anakin brags about being the greates jedi ever. That's [bad] dialogue.It's just sickening. That disgraces Star Wars. I hope Episode 3 will really promise something that all Star Wars fans all have been waiting for, without the teens,without cute and cuddly characters, without a bad dialogue, not so happy (like episode 1-BOMB), more dark, and more evil. THat's what the fans want."
3,"When I was in China, I read a review on this book, sayingC. T. Hsia was funded by C.I.A when writting this book.""the book is bias and full of hatry to Communist China"" thereviewer said, ""that is why this book is banned in China"".I was so curious that the first book I checked out from a U.S.Alibrary was this one. I am disappointed since Hsia is reallybias and sometimes paranoia.He really did not understand the huge difficulty all Chinesewriters faced in the past 100 years. And sometimes I reallydoubt whether he is a Chinese at all? When he sat there laughingat Communist writers, did he realize those were of the sameorigin of his parents and himself?In this sense, this book is just common, not great, since itis lack of love and forgiveness, the basic elements of all greatworks."
3,"Lenny Kravitz shows some great talent here writing, producing and arranging all the cuts here. With standouts like ""Fly Away"", and ""Its Your Life"" the album has some substance. But there cuts like ""Straight Cold Player"" which rips off ""Pick Up the Pieces"" from the Average White Band, and some of the songs gets so slow you find yourself nodding off. Other wise a good album with some good songs, but don't look for a fantastic masterpiece."
3,"A thriller, not a whodunnit, set in messy Mississippi. Dennis, a show diver, comes to town to dive at the Casino. Robert Taylor, a smooth talking blues fan from Detroit, comes with his own agenda. The characters are very colourful if not highly original, and there's definitely room for a few laughs as the plot unfolds. But, unfortunately, not my type of book."
3,"The only thing I was disappointed in was that I just received a CD when I thought I was getting the entire package, i.e., the box that is shown in the advertisement with the manuals, etc. If I had know that I was not getting what was shown I would have just purchased the CD off of E-bay for half the price."
3,"This book did not look like leather to me. It was a disappointment, and looked like paper processed to look like leather. At least to me.I kept it, because I wanted a copy of the trilogy, and the book part was acceptable"
3,"I bought this book because I read several good reviews about it. I was disappointed with the book. I've read many, many self-help, motivating books, and this is by far is a book that I would not bother to recommend. You can find the same info in a million other books, that are written in a lest simplified, more interesting way."
3,"I got an Ipod for myself four months ago. My screen locked permanently after four months of use... I tried contacting apple but they were going to charge me nearly $30 for support. Why should I pay to hear someone tell me how to unlock the screen or even worse yet, ""Go visit an outlet."" Death to Apple customer service. I see Ralph Tresvant's album cover but hear no Ralph Tresvant! OH, DARN IT!Of the product itself it is great, but if you are a miser like me hope it doesn't break down. Apple will charge you an arm and a leg for everything."
3,"go to cyberflix.com and there is a forum about this game. With out those people's help, I wouldn't have beatten it."
3,"Being a huge fan of the other two Tom Wolfe books I've read, ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" and ""A Man In Full"", I was naturally curious to read Wolfe's first book. Unfortunately, I didn't find it to be as sharp or witty as his more recent work, possibly due to this one being non-fiction. I found it to essentially be a set of rambling observations about the state of life in America in the 60's. His choices of subject are clever and put a whole new spin on my view of the United States of the mid-twentieth century but on the whole I found large stretches of the book to be quite dry and, in my opinion, unnecessarily convoluted."
3,"I ordered this and there seems to be some alternate titling going on here. The film I was sent is the 1988 film with Thor, titled ""The Return of the Incredible Hulk,"" although IMDB lists it as ""The Incredible Hulk Returns."" This item's description says it's the 1977 version, also listed on IMDB as ""The Return of the Incredible Hulk"" or ""Death in the Family."" Just a word of warning to avoid confusion. The DVD arrived in good condition, so no complaints there, but the seller needs to update the description to show the proper year of release."
3,"This is a good book but it is wrapped up with prose and serves very little purpose as a non-fictional story and obviously serves very little purpose as a historical reference. However, tthe author is able at some points to engage us in his characters and the big one; the giraffe itself."
3,I don't really care for Bizkit but I did like the stuff they played on the radio. Yes I did hear their albums. This is a good greates hitz album from the band. Not great but still has some good songs like faith and my favorite build a bridge. It's cool to hear it if you don't have anything to hear and just want to hear something to kick back to or jam. For all the bizkit fans why are you so worried what other people say. If they diss this band so what that ain't going to stop you from buying their album. People have the feedom to say whatever they want. If they want to waste their time dissing the band let them you can't stop them. People like to talk smack about Korn but I don't care because I know they're cool.
3,"It was stupid of Jane Fonda to make a statement against the war from the seat of an anti-aircraft gun. The authors make a good case for treason, but the United States was not officially at war, which questions the validity of the charges.I served in Vietnam from 1970-71 and can tell you that the troops would have welcomed Jane Fonda as a performer in a USO show much more than her eventual 1972 performance.For all who now say that the events of 1972 are immaterial, what would be the consequence today of a Hollywood personality appearing in Bhagdad in support of the Baathist Party?Never forget that after the fall of South Vietnam, over 80,000 of their people were systematically murdered by the communists that Jane Fonda supported.For those who really care, we would love to hear Jane Fonda say that she made a mistake. Afterall, Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to thousands of draft dodgers."
3,"The product was valuable for my child but poor in quality. The flash light wasant working,I understand its just $15 but atleast the things should work.Kids love it and play with it constantly."
3,"McIntyre's Enterprise, The First Adventure, comes from the days of the larger Star Trek novels, the days when not as much was known from the various spin-off tv series and movies that followed the original series itself. As such, this novel is interesting, and certainly fills in some of the holes in the series to that time.I found the last third of the novel more action-packed and entertaining than the opening and middle chapters. Like some others here, I found the vaudeville background that the characters are set in to be somewhat tedious, and it took some perseverance on my part to get through that to finish the book. However, the ending is worth it, although one must wonder, given the serious scenario that is portrayed in the last third of the work, if the Enterprise crew wouldn't have been a tad bored with some of their later adventures in comparison to this first one..."
3,"It takes lots of hot water and rubbing to release the 1st blast of peppermint scent from Bronner's Castile Bar Soap. It was great for the first 3 or 4 showers and even made the entire bathroom smell great for a few minutes after the shower.The smaller the bar of soap gets the less amount of scent per square inch you get. Now, 2 months later, there is still a bit of soap left to use but NO SCENT.This is as opposed toPeppermint 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)which I bought at the same time for around the same price, but it maintains its potency because little chunks of actual peppermint leaves permeate the entire bar of soap.Bronner's Castile Bar Soap Peppermint is fun at first, but ultimately not worth the money."
3,"The plane truth about golf is another approach to explain how the golf swing is effected by the path of the club in relation to the motion that the player creates. It is helpful from this stand point of view however I feel if the player, 100 to high 80's shooter stays focus on the plane of the shaft (driver-7 iron) that he or she is swinging they will be more successful in their efforts without to many things to think about. Coach H. Turk Walker"
3,I didn't like the advice in the book..also a bit hard to read. This didn't seem that interesting to me.
3,I guess you could classify me as an illiterate as I am having a rough time getting into the story. I don't read the classics much Bronte being my favorite. I will persevere though.
3,"I read this novel after being thrilled by 'The Hot Zone'. Good as parts of the novel are, I think 'The Cobra Event' demonstrates that Preston's talents are best employed in non-fiction. 'The Cobra Event'ultimately failed to engross this reader because the characters were to obviously constructed as engines to drive Preston's point about biological weapons and bioterrorism. Preston never convinced me that these people could exist outside his story (the dialogue, as one other reviewer pointed out, is pretty ordinary). Cliches abound. The last fifty pages, in particular, are almost embarrasing: this is a writer calling out to all Hollywood producers, 'option this book, please'. Since the publication of this novel, Preston has continued to write fascinating articles in the 'New Yorker', some of them on bioterrorism. I hope they form another non-fiction classic soon."
3,I remember watching battlestar when I was a kid and hadn't seen it for a long time...man I didn't remember it being sooo cheesy. It was fun to watch anyways. I laughed a lot - and not because it was meant to be funny...I'm just glad they re-did battlestar!!
3,"Okay, I'll be honest. I haven't actually read this volume, so I'm basing my opinion on the earlier article that appeared in MHQ early in 1998. And the result is... I hope that the amount of counterfactual speculation in this book-length volume exceeds what was in the magazine entry as otherwise it would be pretty pitiful. The entries in the magazine essay suggested some good possibilities, but none of the authors had any guts to carry their ideas further. I hope (knock wood) that in this book version that they developed some ""intestinal fortitide""."
3,"The whistle locator is the original reason I bought this, but the feature has to be turned ON in order to activate. Now, if I KNEW when I was going to lose my keys, then I would be sure to turn on the whistle activator.The other feature is the recorder. Again, another great idea, bought it for when I was driving and needed to make a quick note, but just barely bump it in the store and every one around you hears your recording. Especially embarrassing if you were goofing around when you recorded on it."
3,"There were no installation instructions included with the light, and none are available on the manufacturer's web site. It isn't too difficult to figure out how to mount and wire the fixture, but if you aren't comfortable doing that on your own, you may want to consider a different product and manufacturer."
3,"Not of the same caliber as Ms. Cauley's ""Optical Illusions"", but a good read nonetheless. If you're not part of the the turbulent telecom industry, this is not your cup of tea. A few innaccuracies here and there, but over all it's got the story correct."
3,"Wherein the special effects wizardry take center stage in this ""big bug"" tale, that alone does not come close to matching the greatness of true sci-fi films like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""The War of the Worlds,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" or even ""Planet of the Apes."" I really feel that the film deserves a ""3 1/2"" rating!Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, and the rest of the ""pretty"" cast have a few more roles to log under their belts before one can take them seriously as thespians.For one into the technical aspects of Hollywood moviemaking, the film is a winner.For someone who wants an intriguing story about monster insects, stick with ""Them!"""
3,"I got it several days ago and found it not fitting presta valve without a converting head,which was showed on the back of the box but not include in the package,whereI checked 3 times."
3,"Characters, story flow, ideas...all make this a fun read. But the repeated, glaring editing problems stick out and taint the experience. It's as if nobody actually read the last proof - there are no less than 50 typos and some other simple errors that you would not expect to see in a major hardcover release. Dietz is a very gifted writer, he just needs someone to proofread before publishing."
3,"It's a good read, but documentation/verification of claims is lacking....which leaves the reader looking for more. If the author cannot 'put up', she should have kept it as a novel."
3,"This is one of those books that is probably rated better if you haven't seen the movie with Edward Norton Jr. and Naomi Watts. The writing is effective but the problem was that I preferred the storyline of the movie over the book. Still, it's worth a read even if you have seen the movie because it fills the characters out nicely. The book portrays Kitty Fane's character more fully than others and seems to be written partly from her viewpoint.That being said, I adore the movie!The Painted Veil"
3,"What a disappointment. The show was recorded in 1973 and the sound is muddy-it's like you've thrown a rug over your speakers. There are no liner notes at all. Frosty has been replaced by an inferior drummer-his drum solo is abysmal. Lee sounds like he's had a rough night and the song selection is minus his ONE hit-""Do you know what I mean"". Pass on this one if you want to maintain fond memories of this early 70's fluke."
3,"At the first listen I was very intrigued by this minimal post rock quartet. The chiming guitars and beautiful arpeggios are quite compelling and mesmerizing. Much of this album could be described as beautiful. Unfortunately after repeated listenings I realized that every song has the same languid tempo, the same time signatures ( 4/4 or 6/8), the same basic dynamic and (simple) melodic structure, the same guitar tone, and they sound as if they were all written in the same key. In fact it's not easy to tell the songs apart from one another. What was at first impressive now sounds formulaic to me. So much so that I found myself saying ""Ok, ok I get it, now do something else."" Good musicians? Undeniably. Good composers? Well... they're not all that."
3,I bought the instructional and Basic videos. The instructional was good and I did learn a few moves but the basic was or I should say doesn't look anything like suppose to. There are some moves that were never in the instructional and why did Billy Blanks say that he hoped I had aready gone through the basic video when I was waiting for the basic workout. The video my say basic but could actually be advanced? Anybody out there know for sure if the basic video is what says it is?
3,"You really can't blame anyone if they decide that this series is not their cup of tea. While it may be a yuri story about young, nubile, Catholic school girls being angsty and dramatic with each other... it's a very DRY yuri story. Those who enjoy the easy going drama stories that focus more on the relationships between the characters and things like working on how they feel will find enjoyable viewing here. If you're someone who desperately needs their conflicts to involve some kind of external catalyst to keep things moving, this series will probably bore you to tears. Definitely for the niche audience who seeks out this kind of storytelling."
3,"This author has much potential in the crime genre however he needs to develop his own style, not take quite as much from other authors such as Ian Rankin At the moment also the final denouement is fairly predictable( I have read 11 so far & predicted every one). Having said that these books improve each time and I recommend them as a very good read. I love the Yorkshire landscape and culture and find this an added attraction in Robinsons' work"
3,"What I like:Size, simplicity, SD card, AA batterys, movie capablity, outdoor picture quality,What I don't like:Flash system is weak, red eye reduction doesn't work well, low light picture quality, length of time for flash recharge, outdoor fill flashThe biggest problem with this camera is the flash. Previously I owned Sonys and was expecting similiar performance but was very disappointed. I've tried serveral settings and still can not take good indoor or outdoor pictures where fill flash is required."
3,I used this for a while and was pretty satisfied... Than I bought a ghd and was blown away. It turned out that the chi was frying my ends and taking about twice the time.
3,"ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE THE FEATURES, THE MUSIC, MP3 COMPATABILITY, AND ROCKER, I AM UNSURE OF THE TOY BARS. THEY FALL OFF PRETTY EASILY AND WHEN MY 2-MONTH OLD IS STRONGER, I WILL BE CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY. I ALSO THINK IT VIBRATES A BIT TOO HARD FOR A YOUNGER INFANT, MAYBE BEYOND 4 MONTHS. MY BABY IS PETITE SO I THINK THE VIBRATIONS ARE TOO JARRING. I KEEP TRYING IT. I AM HOPING AS SHE GROWS SHE IS MORE COMFORTABLE IN IT."
3,"The author provides cool ideas and even some quick ways to implement them. The book should be appreciated for what it is: an ambitious asp cookbook. It's up to you as the developer to apply sound architecture and clean code. What database you use, and what coding methodology you follow, are hardly the point of this book(""Instant ASP"").This book is definitely more appropriate for developers who already have a grasp of asp programming - its value is in its practicality."
3,"getting two great King Diamond albums Abigail and Fatal Portrait. Abigail is most likely King Diamond's definitive album and shows him and the band at their best. As with all the KD albums, the storyline is the best part and Abigail has a haunting classic story that will definately keep you listening to the whole album. Fatal Portrait isn't is good as Abigail but has it's moments and is a good album with a creepy story. The reason I gave this package 3 stars is because the CDs didn't come with the lyrics which was a disappointment."
3,I was slightly disappointed with this release by AdAm X. I had seen Adam X live at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival this year and I was very impressed with his set-- so I picked up Audiobiography. I would have to be in a mellow mood to listen to this CD-- the techno was sort of minimal and that is something that I'm not too much into. Audiobiography will NOT make you want to get up and dance-- so if you're looking for a danceable CD you're not going to find that here.
3,"I study physics in Chile, and this book has been pretty useful for a first course in QM, but I have to note that the first 170 pages are titled ""Problems and Solutions on Electromagnetism""! I hope someone gets word to the editor....Other than that, I'm pretty sure this book will find a place on your private shelf."
3,"My kids love the movie, but didn't like this game nearly as much. It's a run of the mill race car game that uses the Cars characters and that's about it. They lost interest after playing it a few times."
3,I like this style of dish drainer but would have liked the item better if it were made of heavier material and I would prefer the utensil holder to be squared off and not rounded. The utensils slide up with the rounded bottom. I don't use it daily so the product serves the purpose for which it was purchased.
3,"The plot of the book is gripping - the first contact between Earth and Vulcan. What Star Trek fan wouldn't want to read about this encounter? Unfortunately, the book itself fell far below my expectations.Reading through it left me with the craving to know more details about what occured, but on all counts it was lacking. Oftentimes the writer's written style was cumbersome and frankly hard to understand. I found myself re-reading paragraphs in an effort to wrap my mind around a clunky sentence, and frequent shifts between perspectives with no warning only made it worse.Overall, there are parts of the book that make it worth reading, but be prepared to skim paragraphs and be left wanting more than the story offers."
3,"Good quality, it was my 3 yr old's favorite gift of the day. Two things to take note of: they are small! I didn't notice the size -- I'm not sure how long they will last. Also, I wish there was a different type of dispenser at the top. They are made for smaller children, but the large opening at the top is begging for a massive mess."
3,"Esteemed executive, Wess Roberts, weaves an involving teaching tool of equal parts history, fantasy and illustrative instruction. This unique ""how to"" on building and leading a big business hierarchy from the middle, and the top, is also a true to history, interpretive extraction of the Hun empire revived and empowered by one man, Attila the Hun. Attila's own success is not only an analogous base for the lessons at hand but also their validation. An easy, concise read for top and middle managers on the go; an overlooked gem in a pile of rubblous hype."
3,"Arrived assembled, no dings or scratches. I didn't see in the ad and was very happy to get a good case, a sharpening tool, chain oil, mix oil, and of course the chainsaw adjusting tool. Like the Poulan trimmer I ordered the same day, the saw started easily and went straight to work. I don't know about long-term yet but initial quality is above and beyond.Now I know the longer term and my review went from 5 to 2 stars. The idle went to crap before I used one bottle of chain oil. Won't run unless ""floored.""Now, longer term the idle is better, still never runs smoothly, a lot of restarting going on. Thank you for the input, but I didn't run it floored and burn it out. It started doing it after about 10 minutes of gentle use. The floored come in when it quit running."
3,"Steven Seagal is an actor of the highest caliber. On Deadly Ground is a brilliant directorial debut from the infinite talent of Seagal. Two hours of non-stop destruction of the environment to kill the baddies, and in the end he blows the mind of his audience with a speech on how we must save the environment. Steven flawlessly reinvents the action film genre. If you really like this one, see Fire Down Below. I can only hope that he will someday finish the environmental trilogy. The oeuvre of Steven Seagal will never be complete without a third evironmental epic. Go Steven!"
3,"Ok, the story line is cute...but not as cute as Christian Campbell! Ha! I love him, that's why I bought this movie."
3,"It's a great holder for my GPS.However, the temporary stick mount doesn't hold up well after a couple of uses.I don't always get the same van at work so I have to change the mount around."
3,This product works pretty well but can not be relied upon by itself to completely clear up oily skin. It should be used with a good moisturizer if it's going to really do it's job well.
3,"This book offers some good ideas but so much the text is devoted to selling itself (heck, we already bought the book!), and the key sections on the drills are hard to follow and represent a rigid series of exercises that I for one found impossible to follow past an early point. Overall, I wish I had bought a different book to help me improve my swimming technique."
3,"I doubt I would introduce M. F. to newcomers with this album, but it's vintage jazz from the 70s that I'm delighted to hear remastered on CD. The group's take on McCartney's ""Jet"" is uninspired; the title track cooks as hot as that band ever did; and everything else fall somewhere in between. At its current low price (under $10), it's an especially happy bargain."
3,"It's interesting to observe how dry academic language can take the juiciest gossip, the most outrageous of unfounded rumors, and the most gruesome tales of betrayal, debauchery, and degeneration and turn it into a tedious labor requiring considerable concentration just to keep track of the action.Weakened by unimaginative writing, this tome is primarily of interest for its wealth of genealogical detail. It includes stories of the popes from the tenth century to the nineteenth, but there has to be a more readable source for that material."
3,"I bought the PNY unit to transfer pictures between my PC and compact flash cards. It saves my camera batteries and makes managing CF cards a breeze. I'm running Win2K pro and haven't experienced any serious setup or usage problems. The transfer speed is acceptable. I have not tried a smart media card yet. The CF reader shows up in explorer as a removable media device; my imaging software also finds it with no problems. The unit only has a power indicator and there is no visible way to tell when the reads & writes are finished. Also, while the USB driver works fine on my PC, the user interface for ejecting cards is clunky. Though I'm not unhappy with the PNY card reader, I'm not overjoyed. I would very much like a status light and a better eject method on my next card reader."
3,"I have been studying servant leadership recently and was excited to read what Kennth Blanchard, author of the ""One Minute Manager"" would have to say on the topic; especially from a Christian point of view.I was hoping to find a meaty, substantial book with examples and illustrations from his extensive experience in business and leadership. Instead, ""Servant Leader"" is merely a collection of quips, quotes, and a few Bible verses.It is so disappointing when good authors market these tidbit books. Blanchard must have some wonderful insights and knowledge but this particular book is one which offers more milk than meat. The pages are beautrifully illustrated and the color graphics are very professional - it looks great on the coffee table.However, if you are looking for a fuller treatment of Servant Leadership, I recommend the recent books by James Hunter: ""The Servant"" and ""The World's Most Powerful Leadership Principle""."
3,"It's not a bad adventure, but I've had players who totally despise it. I never got around to playing the second half (Curse of Tsathoggua), but Trail of Tsathoggua is railroad city. It also suffers from a miserable payoff -- the investigator's think they're gonna find a lost city and end up with a tiny little temple.I had one player tell me ""I hate this game, I hate this scenario, it ...!"" Still feel bad about that. Although, I have learned to GM a lot better since then."
3,I purchased this clamp to be able to assemble some picture frames. It was more light weight than I expected. I had purchased only one. Four probably would have made the project easier. The clamp was engineered well. Allowing me access to all the locations that I needed to nail.
3,"I'm not familiar with the series, so I review this as a stand alone anime movie. It was a bit short, but full of action, maybe if you get to know the main caracter you could get attached to him and buy the series. Didn't worked for me, once I saw it the first time, I didn't watch it a second time. Only for the hardcore fan, I think..."
3,"I was looking for a guide to older classical LPs, so this wasn't really what I was looking for."
3,Black leather thong sandal with small heel and gold embellishments. They are classy and chic but slightly too small. I would order a half size bigger next time but I can still get away wearing the size I ordered. Not good walking shoes. Purely fashionable.
3,The plot seemed a bit flimsy Many of his books are so much better. I would always look at his latest to see if it sounds good
3,"Still the same fascinating characters, with some new additions. The plot was a bit much this season. Good acting from young talent!"
3,The book is an excellent idea. Very nice pictures and lots of information on the body. The posses are VERY stiff and not very helpful in studying and drawing. I was disappointed in this book and would not purchase it given the chance at half the price.
3,"The best thing about these films is you know what you're going to get. If you just fancy some action, good fight scenes, explosions, a lilltle love interest and comedy all wrapped up in a good guys and bad guys movie then this is for you. There is a plot regarding smuggling people, but it's incidental. Yhe movie plays on the familiarity of the two central characters. This being no 4 it's almost a soap. Joe Pesci delivers the best lines and manages to become more endearing and annoying as the film goes on. Hopefully they will stop at 4, and the Lethal Weapon series will be given the credit it deserves. Lethal Weapon 5 would be just one more than we really need. In a nutshell if you liked any of the others buy it. If you didn't you won't like this one either. Region 2 actually has some decent extras for a change. Thanks guys"
3,"We are using this volume in a class on Jefferson and the early 1800s. The class finds it redundant and disorganized.The provocative title takes a bit of unraveling, but once you do there is less to it than imagined. While ""Negro President"" may have been a term by which Jefferson was described by his enemies back then, it means something quite different today.Finally, The book seems really to be about Thomas Pickering, not Jefferson, with many chapters titled ""Pickering and . . . "" Perhaps he should have been named in the title. But then, of course, who would have purchased it?"
3,"This is a beautiful and authentic book, however the recipe for aji de gallina either is written for someone with an iron stomach or has a huge typo. It calls for 1 and 1/2 CUPS of aji amarillo paste, not the normal 2-4 tbsps to taste as every other recipe I have ever found. We trusted the book and made it as written and unless you can handle large amounts of extreme heat in one bite, you will be sick afterwards. This has got to be a typo. Warning to any Peruvian food newbies: 1 and 1/2 cups is painful.Great book otherwise, though!"
3,"The storyline for this novel is good. I don't want to give away the plot, but suffice it to say that it is a typical ""bored aristocrat meets beautiful and proud woman seeking to right a wrong.""The low evaluation is based upon the publishing company's editing of this story. The person who edited this tale could neither spell, write a grammatically correct sentence, avoid typos, or refrain from transposing words or phrases! It was a travesty! I often had to reread sentences several times to make sense of them.There were far too many editing errors to make this an easy and pleasant read...as it should have been."
3,"Not as good as Skyline, but helps the Floridian get his Cinti chili fix. Easy to make, and certainly worth the money."
3,"Mr. Bento holds a LOT of food in those four seemingly small bowls. Packed as shown in the picture, it is more than I can reasonably eat for lunch. Also, the largest container has a tendency to leak even when the lid is tightly closed. It keeps food nicely warm, though, and it is very easy to carry. It might be a good choice for someone who has a VERY big appetite, and doesn't need to pack soup."
3,"I like the first one, don't get me wrong, it was just kinda slow moving. I love the visuals in the second, since it takes place in Hell. I like that we learn about Pinhead's origins and that Kirsty reminds him of who he is. I thought that scene was intense, especially the first time I saw the movie. Don't listen to people who say it was horrible, or who say it was fantastic. Its worth a rent for sure."
3,"talk about WEIRD childhood....reading this book left me blank....i don't know if i hate it or love it.....this is weird because i usually feel strongly one way or another....i guess that what makes this book controversial....i am going to watch the movie and see how the director ""sees"" the book.....i am sure it will be interesting to watch."
3,"1984 is one of those novels I have intended to read for years, and had never gotten around to. However, I finally managed to get to it, for better or for worse. Orwell's dystopian novel has left me feeling rather prosaic, and I'm not quite sure how to express my feelings regarding the text. In the simplest terms, I didn't like the novel; but I don't think I was supposed to. And I certainly don't regret taking the time to read it."
3,"Small and compact but is a little difficult to use. Magnifying is great when you figure out how to hold it, to view coins or gem stones. received in a timely manner."
3,"I rate this book a three star book. I rated it this because it could have been longer and it could have had a better ending. The characters are Pattie, Joe, Father, Malcolm, Guide, Sarah, Jason, and Jasons mother. A hand picked group got to go on a space ship to another planet because the earth is dying. They all got to take one book with them. Pattie who was to young to understand what they were doing picked an empty journal and when they needed it to write in they found... To find out what they found read this book!"
3,"I have enjoyed every other book she has written, no this one. I stuck it out to the end, wading through interminable recitations of unimportant family lineage hoping I would be rewarded. I wasn't. I knew who, why and how ""did it"" long before the end, both in the modern and historical tales. Everybody in this book was too stupid by half. Ms McCrumb seems to be losing steam. Her muse might be tired. I longed for the bite and wit of ""IF I'd Killed Him When I Met Him"". This one read like she put her wordprocessor on autopilot."
3,"The only reason I am giving this coffee pot a 3 is because I am a person who drinks a sick amount of coffee so size wise it is not ideal for more than one persons use, but yet I don't like the big 12 cup coffee pots either because I never drink all the coffee. I love this coffee maker it has been the best machine out of all the ones I have bought. It is the best thing in the world to wake up early in the morning to brewing coffee. Please read the directions on how to set the programmer because I messed up the first time using it because I thought I was smart enough to figure it out on my own. Because it is only a 4 cup pot I fill the water up to the top of the water canister on the machine until it is full but not enough to over flow it, and add 6 spoon fulls of coffee and it makes about 6-8 cups which is a perfect number for me. I absolutely recommend this because it is a decent priced good quality machine."
3,"I got this book shortly before Halloween -- I was looking for a good thriller for the season, but it was just okay. It started kinda slow, and I didn't really feel any sort of attachment towards the characters, but the plot and the action picked up pretty well about 1/3 of the way through. I liked the story well enough, it had some interesting ideas, but it didn't have the ""oompf"" to make me care much about the characters, and it was sort of predictable. All in all, not bad, not great."
3,"1. Very little information in this book-- it could have been one third the size but it's filled with chatter and stories-- mostly about Chris. Interesting stories, okay, but I am not reading the book for stories.2. The book is based on the premise of evolution which is presented as fact. It's not fact.3. The book was also clearly written for men, and I wonder if they went back and added ""wo"" to every reference just to adapt the first book to women.4. Chris, in particuliar, uses four-letter words through the whole book. Maybe men don't mind, but I do. I do not need to read that language on every page.If I had known, I would have saved my money and bought a serious book about health and fitness."
3,"This movie always reminded me of one of those life channel TV movies. It is however, well constructed and there are some good performances, especially De Mornay as the psycho nanny from H E L L ! It's kind of predictable, but I thought it did keep my interest. The DVD transfer looks good."
3,"I read all the reviews about players not being compatible. We used it in our XBOX with ease. But then one of the games I bought would not play in the XBOX and I thought, ""no big deal, I can put it in the combo player. The XBOX was easy to set up."" Boy was I wrong. I have to take a break after trying 25 different codes so far. As far as why the one game won't read, who knows. Usually the XBOX will play videos that the combo player won't so this is unusual."
3,"I know a lot of people that read this book really found itamazing. I only did on the middle part, when the kidnapping begins. Irecommend this book for people that read regularely. But, like me, a rare reader (i actually had to read it for class) i kind of got bored. The story is a really good idea, but if you want a book that you can get the stroy right when you open the book, then Killing Mr. Griffin is not for you. It has a lot of details, personnally, a bit ""too much"" details. Anyway, the book and story was good, as Lois Duncan is too!"
3,"It makes great toast. Looks good too. And the countdown lights are a nice touch. My only reservation is that the increments on the browning selector are too large. There is no way to make fine adjustments in the degree of browning desired. This makes the toaster just OK in my view. That said, I have no regrets."
3,"This book is very dry and terse. It has all of the required content but it doesn't provide much perspective of how it should be used. You could use it as a reference, but I recommend the XML Schema Companion before this one."
3,"This product has a great design in that it is easy to clean by removing the lid from the top if needed. If it was constructed of a little thicker, stronger material I would give it a four star rating. If it also included a through-the-wall length of pipe, I would give it a five star rating. I installed it a month ago. When the weather gets cold will it keep the heat in the house??? I will let you know. Most other dryer vent hoods do not give you a positive seal or the ease of cleaning builtup lint that the Heartland 21000 does."
3,"101 Ways to Bug Your Parents is about a boy that wants to go to a convention. He can't because his parents did not have the money to go. If you like to bug your parents then read this book to find out more.My opinion of the book is it is a bit dumb, but I do have a favorite part. It is when someone said ""glow-in-the-dark-butt."" I recommend third and up should read this book. If you like to bug your parents, then this is a good book for you."
3,"Accurate product description and prompt delivery. You will need good eye sight to read the very finely printed scale on either side of this map measurer. This is more of a tool for home use (trip planning) than for road travel or hiking. My measurer arrived slightly damaged, probably through shipping. The protective plastic lens had fallen off and had to be carefully reglued."
3,"On my first Kindle I could search for a word and there it was. On the Fire I get every word that contains my search word but never get the actual word itself. An example is ""pone"" which comes up within other words such as op""pone""nt, post""pone"", etc. But where is the actual meaning of pone? Don't know why it is doing this and it is useless. I had to go to my old Kindle to look it up."
3,I like the idea of this book more than the book itself. I tried reading a few of these with my girlfriend in order to kick start some philosophical/ethical conversation but not much came of it.
3,"Goldmine is an okay mag for vinyl collectors but unless your only cares are centered around Elvis and the Beatles then you may be disappointed. I understand those two acts bring more at auctions than anything else but who would watch sports if the only teams you ever heard about were the Yankees, Cowboys, and Lakers? I'm sure there are people out there who will have blood shoot from their eyes after reading my review but my stance is undisputed. Just count the covers."
3,I was a bit disappointed with this book. Some chapters were very good - others not so good. I won't be buying any more books in this series. Thanks. Gwen
3,"This is a simple filtration unit. It uses a single-stage 3M filtrate 1000 filter. The filter is easily replaced. The filter rating of 1000 implies that it is not good for removing very fine particles (i.e. pet dander). I run the unit 24 hours a day at the second highest setting. It is most effective at it's highest setting, but at it's highest setting it is extremely loud. Instead of getting one of these ... if you have central A/C and allergies, get a 3M Filtrete rated at 2200. It is a better overall solution."
3,these glasses look cool and are comfortable... but I have broken about 7 pair so far... though I still want another pair.
3,"this video is classic glamrock. no new fight footage, but there is ego oozing out of the video as soon as you open it. it was entertaining at certain points. who would have thought that wearing socks could help you get a leg lock?"
3,"It took me a while to get into the flow of the book but once I did, it was a pretty decent book. However, the ending totally ticked me off. There was plenty of drama but the ending made all the drama rather pointless. What's the use of drama if you don't learn from it? Why suffer through so much tragedy if you're just going to end up back at square one?"
3,"Though this book was written very well, no doubt about that, it was somewhat pointless. It was just about the life a certain person. To be honest I don't care. I won't say it wasn't written well, because it wasn't. Everything was good, except the plot. It was an ok book. Wasn't great, but wasn't the worst thing I've ever read."
3,"This is a great book for kids, and my daughter is excited to have all her friends fill it out. EXCEPT as another reviewer mentioned, there is a line on every page for each child to complete the statement ""I know God loves me because...""There's also a page in the back, telling the children they should ""ask Jesus to come into your heat and be your Best Friend."" I have spent the afternoon putting labels over the God statements, and had to remove the last page as this would be extremenly offensive to her friends who practice other religions. Just a warning because there was no indication when purchasing this book that there was religious content. It's easy enough the cover up the statements. In fact, we used our own labels to create a line that says ""My plans for the summer..."""
3,"I liked the book because I liked the action and the drama and suspense. I also like the book because I liked the way martyn and alex tried to set up dean, to make it look like dean killed martyns father william."
3,"good points, no music, bad points, dubbed over as in recordings overlapped and repeated, no stand out passages of sound. so looks like you have fooled a few but not me, listenable. check out my five star reveiws on amazon"
3,"Bought the album after hearing someone talk about the group. Thought the voices were okay (baritone was the best) but in some songs didn't blend properly. Selection of pieces was interesting . . . pop, classical, opera. Good album for ""background"" music."
3,"The video transfer of this film is too dark, but an adjustment to your TV brightness setting will yield an acceptable viewing. The extras are quite informative especially the part dealing with Ludlum's knowledge of the intelligence community."
3,"SUPERNATURAL is a good comeback for Santana, but unfortunately, the appearance of numerous featured guests, plus a lack of consistently strong material, prevents this album from being an example of Santana at his best. Even his 80s albums had a voice consistent throughout each album, which this one lacks. The important Santana discs are the first three albums, ESSENTIAL SANTANA, the two BEST OFs, GREATEST HITS, or even CARAVANSERAI, WELCOME, LOTUS, BORBOLETTA, AMIGOS, MOONFLOWER, FESTIVAL, INNER SECRETS, MARATHON, or ZEBOP! If you're satisfied with a Top 40-oriented sound and style, however, SUPERNATURAL is a great choice."
3,"...I found the DVD played better on its second run...William Castle's classic was his first collaboration with horror legend Vincent Price. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is a surprisingly gentle (mainly) mystery in which millionaire Frederick Loren (Price) offers seven people-four men and three women-$10,000 to attend the birthday party of his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart). The catch is that the party is an all night affair held in a haunted mansion that has already claimed the lives of seven people: four men and three women...The fun includes blood dripping from the ceiling, hilarious mummified white-haired apparitions, a severed head in a suitcase and guns cased in miniature coffins as ""party favors"" and of course, the walking skeleton. Not scary, but a good ""horror"" for family audiences. The extras on the DVD I viewed were pretty basic, just bios & filmographys for Castle and Price..."
3,"Pretty good-sized iron for guys with pretty good-sized hands. Super slick ss sole plate...unit is capable of putting out a lot of steam...heats up fast...but I'm sending mine back 'cause the steam control dial does not stay where I set it--any li'l touch of my knuckles & bammo! you just moved it to a different setting w.o. even knowing you've done so! Very annoying. If that kinda thing doesn't bother you, then go for this iron as you get a lot for your $. I just tend to want tool settings to remain static unless I ""tell"" it to change. That's just me."
3,"This was a good story for a sequel. Overall, Marjane brought us back to the world of her youth and recaptured the changing feelings toward a culture unfamiliar to most. With humor, wit, and thoughtfulness I enjoyed the book--however, it left me with a less than happy ending (but isn't that life?)."
3,"This volleyball says super soft on it. It's no softer than a normal volleyball. Super soft is false advertising. Other than that, it does seems to be of good quality construction."
3,"I'm a fan of Michael Ball however, this DVD concert is much different than his previous concerts. Not one of my favorites. I would not recommend this product."
3,"The good part is that you get 3 pairs of pretty good earplugs. Typical multi flange construction. Cord is pretty thin. As the other reviews state they don't come with a case, just a little bag. No big deal."
3,"While the narrative centered around camp life is fascinating (Fletcher seems to loosen up and ""flow"" much better in these sequences), the confusing descriptions of troop movements and battle sequences are vague. Many Civil War books suffer from this stilted language, often failing to convey in words what the movements on the battlefield actually looked like. I have always had a difficult time picturing the soldiers moving from place to place during battle, despite the author, perhaps the fault is mine, but Fletcher's writing certainly didn't help me overcome my confusion. He does a marginal job of describing the actual terror (perhaps he was fearless), and I found myself skipping whole sections of troop movement descriptions. But nevertheless I was entertained by his story. He is without question a forthright and honest soldier, not a professional writer, and his honesty and humor come through clearly, elevating his story above the level of many other Civil War narratives."
3,"The headphones are good, but not great. The charger is just a USB charger with the Zune logo on it. The extra cable is only there so you have something to plug into the USB charger, and the headphone splitter/remote is really only useful if you're planning to share your traveling Zune experience with a 2nd person. And if this is a Travel Pack, why is there no car charger included?The real draw of this kit is how all of these accessories work along with the case. The case is compartmentalized, so all Zune-branded products fit snugly into predefined niches which keeps everything from rattling around. You can purchase non-branded versions of all these accessories for a lot less money, but if you're really hung up on organization, this is probably the way you want to go."
3,"Henry Spearman,an Economics professor at Harvard university,is on a holiday at St. John.His holiday is spoiled by a murder of an army general at the hotel at which he is staying. The professor,who tends to explain everything with economic theories, is determined to find the murderer-using economic theories of course. A change of events occur,and a person drowns.Two days later a judge is murdered. The local police associate these activities with black racialist groups. They even arrest two suspects. But as it is they turn out to be wrong. the prof. finds out otherwise. This book is a slow-paced mystery and you might find it interesting so take a look."
3,"Well the deo works as it should but the product description was misleading. I only received a single stick whereas it says ""Pack of 6""."
3,"Kept your interest, but lacked much detail in respect to most persons encountered. It felt at times like an over-stated personal travel log. No matter how I tried, I found the main protagonist a person that may have a problem with actual facts concerning his ordeal. Somewhere during the telling the truth might have been lost in fact or translation. Overall, a good read nonetheless..."
3,"I just took and barely passed my A+ Hardware exam. This was one of the 2 books I read in preparation [the other was the A+ ExamCram2 Practice Questions and it had similar shortcomings]. Maybe it's true that no single book can be comprehensive. I found this book to be informative but not closely reflective of the test itself. This book will help you pass but that's it. I agree with a previous reviewer - if you want to score really high, you'll need some hands-on experience.I just passed the OS exam on August 14th. In this case, I think the book was closer to the test. However, I passed with a low grade so I stand by my original opinion."
3,The manufacturer description shows push on/push off function along with rotary control. This unit does not have the push on/push off feature. That feature is reserved for the manufacturer's rotory dimer only models. I would love this unit to have the push on/off feature instead of having to turn the knobs all the time.
3,"Several stories of love. Wanting love; having love; losing love. Young love; old love; new love. Very sweet.I always enjoy a peek into other's lives, especially when they are in far away countries."
3,"Having loved Thousand Autumns and been challenged by Cloud Atlas, I find this earlier work impossibly contrived. Maybe it was a great excuse for the author to travel across the world, but if I want atravelbook I will buy one. This one positively oozes Local Colour. That analysis of the London Tube -ugh!"
3,"I say this is a 'gem' only because the CD is exceptionally hard to find, no longer in print, and basically available only second hand these days. In addition, the song 'Another Lover' is also hard to find these days and basically is about the only reason one would acquire this album to obtain a clean copy of that catchy song. Also, 'Into You' is a favorite of mine...both songs bring back fond memories."
3,My daughter recenty discovered Lionel's music and was blown away by his smooth meaningful songs. Lionel is not just for your mother's generation only!
3,I had this as a VHS tape a long time ago and lost it. Was glad to see it out on DVD. Love the song selection. Was disappointed at the video quality. Was dark and did not appear to be cleaned up from its original release.
3,"This movie sees Kunta Kinta, aka Toby as an old man, with the blacks now being civilized living as slaves. The only better is the first entry in the 6 tape set of the Roots movies, which aired on American TV in the 1970s and broke ratings records for TV that I believe still stand today. The movies in the series get progressively more racist as the Afro Americans were kept alive and forced into civil slavery. The N word is used about 20 times during the movie."
3,"The Divine Yes -- the living legacy of Dr. E. Stanley Jones, one of the world's best-known and most respected evangelists. Written in the fourteen-month period between a crippling stroke and his death, it is the personal record of Dr. Jones' struggle with physical limitations and his inspiring spiritual victories. It is, most of all, the story of God's power to use all things for the good of those who love him.""I have often said half jokingly that when I get to heaven, I will ask for twenty-four hours to see my friends, and then I shall go up to Him and say, 'Haven't you a world somewhere which has fallen people who need an evangelist like me? Please sen me there.' For I know no heaven beyond preaching the Gospel to people. That is heaven to me. It has been, is, and ever shall be."" -- December, 1972, Sat Tal, India."
3,"Primo Levi's Story tears at your heart, but so does his ability as a writer. His tale is informative, and truthful. It gives us deep insight into the world of Auschwitz, the most terrible Concentration Camp in Nazi Germany... Levi just isn't a writer. If you are a fanatic of this period in history, and particularly this aspect of the war, give the book a try, it will add to your knowledge, it just wont be a fun process."
3,"The author attempts to break down the different concepts of CA real estate by presenting the concept then explaining it with an example. There are a few errors noted (mostly in spelling and grammar), but other than that the book is very easy to read and understand if you have a real estate dictionary or some other type of outside text help. The author goes over the basic principles of CA real estate, but when it comes to specifics, the book is really lacking. Overall, this book is great if one decides to use it for a class to supplement the instructor, but I wouldn't use this book in lieu of an instructor."
3,"I thought that the movie was based on the book, not visa versa, so when the book caught my eye at the library I checked t out.It wasn't such a horrible read, but it did read like the movie, and gave no extra information, motivation, etc. to any of the characters, nor did it enhance the story line.My suggestion? See the movie, at least it has the visuals."
3,"A nice little shoe rack, but not for big boots, tennis shoes or small shoes (kids)I can't fit my tennis shoes on the bottom rack and they are NOT HUGE SHOES, there is just not enough space between the top and bottom row."
3,This is one of those movies that you want to see because you actually prefer a certain actor and then you end up interested in the story because it is told so well.
3,"I am basically a novice at creating web pages. I have created acceptable web pages using Front Page Express, and FrontPage 2000. I downloaded a trial version of Hotmetal Pro, and tried it as well. I found the program ponderous and definitely not for someone who just wanted to easily create a website and be done with it. I have no doubt I could have figured it out if I had wanted to spend several hours experimenting with it. But I simply wanted to create a website, and not learn the intricacies of HTML and the intricacies of this program. I rated it a 3 because it is probably a good program for people who want to get more involved with it, but it was not for me."
3,"Sure wish that they had some plan, calmer colors to choose from, but if you have an elongated toilet seat - they don't make the covers anymore. So, if you want a cover, and some color, these work."
3,The turntable mechanism is not as smooth as it should be. I have others from years ago and the old ones turn better than the new ones.
3,"Good book, but it doesn't explain a lot of things. After reading it, I felt as if the author somehow missed the whole point. I know for a fact that many crop circles actually are man-made, but with fabricated crop circles, the maize gets broken in the process. With real crop circles (the phenomenon that hasn't really been totally explained yet) the maize is left bent to the ground but unbroken and the area is 'charged' (cell phones won't get reception inside them, electronic devices set on the ground no longer function, people feel tingling sensations while inside). The book was well written and the stories of the hoaxers were funny, but when I picked this book up, I was hoping to find an explanation for the real crop circles."
3,"For less than $10, you can't expect a perfect repair. This product is acceptable and the result is much, much better than the hole that was in the fabric."
3,"La maleta para la camara esta muy bonita, el espacio que tiene y las bolsas aditionales se ven muy buenas. Desafortunadamente no es el producto para mi. Compra esta funda solamente si eres profesional y necesitas dos camaras y mas lentes. La funda es demasiado grande para un amateur. Es muy muy grande e incomoda para poder viajar, Yo la llamaria una mini maleta. Si eres fotografo profesional, comprala. Pero si solo quieres proteger tu camara con una funda comoda y llevarla a tus viajes y aventuras, es a NO! No la compres.De hecho la regrese y Amazon inmediatamente nos mando el return slip y nos dio el refund. Amazon was Great!"
3,"It is OK considering the price. But not that effective, it is just OK. Whenever I use it, I just want to sneeze. I dont know why."
3,"These authors can write a good Victorian mystery. It helps that they delve into the history books, and use actual incidences that lend credence to their story. This book talks about Queeen Victoria's son, Albert's propensity for married lovers - some of the worst kept secrets from that era. Daisy was a real person and was actually involved with the Prince. The story is realistic, and the characters are niceley portrayed. I really like Charles and Kathryn and think they make a good detective team. The mystery behind the story is a good one, and the motive is ""Oh so Victorian"". I recommend this series to those that enjoy this period."
3,"I remember reading that one of the Donnas said if they just slowed their songs down they'd be more popular. Well, they did it and it worked. They're all over Tv and all the little girls are snapping up their records, but the music kinda [...]. Other people are saying exactly what I think: predictable. All the songs sound the same. And not much fun. Get rid of that girl was a fun song. [...]I like some of the song titles,[...]"
3,"A good, fun read that surely uplifts your spirits. A book about redemption, reconciliation, and hope. This isn't the most fascinating book I have ever read. Some of it is downright silly. I also think Neenan's transformation was too easy to be convincing. We never really do see the earlier, nasty Neenan. However, if you can get over the premise and description of the afterworld, the book is quite fun and uplifting. Very different from the other Greeley books I have read."
3,"carry the readers interest. The author has been doing this for a long time and knows how to turn the pages. But the ending is a big let down, realistic, perhaps, but a disappointment nonetheless. The facts are scary enough to make it a worthwhile read."
3,This would not fit properly on my faucet and seemed like it would've fallen off with water pressure even if it had fit. The upside was that when I called BOON customer service they were nice as can be and were very accomodating and agreed to replace it with any other Boon product I would like (within close value).
3,"A pleasant re-telling of the familiar story. But why, oh why did it have Joseph, en route to Bethlehem, recite the blessing for breaking bread in Hebrew (...hamotzi lechem min ha-aretz...) while the rest of the dialogue was in English?"
3,Very interesting book. Good thoughts - you will enjoy this one. Just use your head when reading. Kind of runs along the line of Way of the Peaceful Warrior.
3,I've been using the battery since I received it a few weeks ago. I've noticed that the battery does not seem to have the same charge retention of the original. When the my macbook gets close to the end of the charge I usually get a warning to plug-in but for some reason this battery does not alert the computer and it will just shut down into sleep mode with no warning. Again I don't know if it's something with the battery but it's something that the original MacBook Apple battery never did. The Color of the casing is a different color from the MacBook casing itself and because it's on the bottom of the computer I don't really care but it's not the same. The charge indicator on the battery is not as well designed as the original battery. Overall the battery works but you get what you pay for.
3,Hero wins through despite impossible odds. A very fast moving story line with many twists and turns to delight even the most jaded of readers. A disappointment that major chunks of plot that are very similar to ICE STATION. Swap water for ice and the chase scenes are virtually interchangeable. The use of animals in the plot of the first book was novel - in the second it was a case of deja vu.
3,"Out of the box, this hand blender was great. It lasted ten years. We almost never used it for a long time, then came our smoothie habit starting about three years ago. After a bunch (20) of smoothies made using frozen berries yogurt and bananas, the seal/plate behind the blades came loose, then after another ten or fifteen uses the head stopped engaging without being forced, then the shaft connection somehow gave up the ghost and now we're in the market for a new one.I'm not sure we could have found a better one, but its not ""for life"" as another reviewer said. if it were, I would not be here writing this."
3,"This was the first book by Katherine Stone that I have read. I have read one other since I first read this book and have read this book a second time since then. (about 6 months ago was the first time) I definately disagree with the other reviews in the fact that I didn't consider it boring. No it is not an action packed sit on the edge of you seat book. But, it is a good read in my opinion. It has kind of a calm story line, gradual and not too suspenseful (sp) It is one of those stories that you go aaahhh how sweet. Maybe a touch on the corny side but I read it twice and liked it. I don't usually read books twice either. Would I recommend it? Well if your looking for suspense and action then no. If you like just a sweet kinda fairy tale tyle story then yes."
3,"When i saw that movie, those were the 2 songs that made me die hard led zeppelin fans. Page's Improv is outstanding and one of a kind to a level beyond anything i've seen from any other band exept maybe Clapton and Hendrix. And those two songs, The intro to BlackDog, and all of Since i've been loving you is so unbelievable good, yet they didn't include it. i can't believe it. All songs are good, but they are pretty long."
3,"I purchased this book to obtain some recipes for things like Italian sauces that didn't require 30 lbs. of tomatoes which this book has. I succeeded in making 2 qts. of sauce with one of the recipes. However, most of the recipes are so small that they could barely satisfy one person. While one could double the recipe, you aren't technically supposed to mix doubled recipes together because it could affect the acidity so you would actually have to can the 2 batches separately. Getting 2 or 3 cups out of a recipe seems pointless. I was hoping for recipes that would allow you to put up at least 4 half-pints/pints. Many of the recipes aren't even for canning but for refrigeration or freezing. I do have to say though that the book does have some recipes that you won't find anywhere else which makes it somewhat worthwhile to have."
3,"I enjoyed the book, but I did find Dodd to be just a little to robot like. You have to figure that he would get harden to death and suffering, but I think that Forester takes it just a little to far. On the up side the action sequences are really well done."
3,"Two problems. First off the sound quality is low even when the handset is right next to the base. People I was talking to kept asking me to speak up, and I had to say ""excuse me"" all the time to get them to repeat something I couldn't hear. But the real big problem was: whenever my printer would warm up from powersave mode, the phone would reset! I never experienced that problem with any other telephone or electrical device. So this phone was unusable to me."
3,"I was disappointed by this documentary. Rather than spending the 45 minutes going into the true ""Secrets of the Bible"" this was actually a historical timeline of the archaeologists who research the Bible. Now it's true that some of these people are interesting, however the life and times of the archeologists is hardly what I would consider ""The Bible's Greatest Secrets"". The documentary itself was a little over the top, trying to force mystery and suspense when there was really very little said. I would hope that there are better documentaries out there on this topic. This is not one I would recommend unless your interest is in the bios of the archeologists."
3,"Why, I'm wondering, do people have to ruin books? I LOVED this book, and I saw that it was being made into a movie, and I was really excited. And I knew it would be different from the book, just because of the trailer, but I was still looking forward to it. And now I watched it, and it's definitely not what I expected. It was just too different, and if I hadn't loved the book then I never would have even liked the movie."
3,"I have always loved these towels for camping and then came along children and they are great to take to the beach, especially when you are hiking there and want to lighten your load. However, my children ages 2 and 6, complain these are too small. I would say they are great to dry off with but certainly not to wrap up in. I would go ahead and buy the x-lrg size for all your family members."
3,"These candles smell wonderful, but if I sit next to one for too long, they give me a headache. I'm giving mine away to friends with stronger brains."
3,The book was carelessly placed in the package. The cover was bent in half. It was brand new and bent. The reason I bought it new was so it would be in perfect condition. Guess I shouldn't have spent the extra money.
3,This is a pretty chintzy product. First it arrived in pieces due to poor packaging. The windows are flimsy plastic that do not fit all that well as two of them came out during shipping. Easily put back in place however they all rattle. The feeding wells are not well designed. This was $20 and it is perhaps worth $10. You need to look for something better and/or less expensive as this one is not a very good value.
3,"This western spoof starring the comic legend Bob Hope,pretty Jane Russell and the King of the Cowboys Roy Rogers is excellent humor for the family.Directed by a former cartoonist,it is full of cartoon gags!"
3,"I am a graduate student at Columbia. Richard Davis was my time series professor.This book is really rigorous and well organised. Theory is present, but we cannot see enough methods and applications. Yet the title suggest that there are some methods. It is a useful book for academics, but if you want to go in the financial industry (quant, strategist or trading) do not buy this book because not much of the content is applicable.The software ISTM 2000 is really impressive: powerful and quick. I recommend this software and think it could be used on trading floors, or in a hedge fund, for speculative purposes, or arbitrage."
3,"I suppose I should have thought these stories more than simply 'mildly entertaining' had I not been first introduced to G.K Chesterton's ""Father Brown"" series (Father Brown is a 'detective') and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"" series, both which, for me, far surpass the stories here from E.W. Hornung. Perhaps imagination withstanding, I believe Raffles fell short of the other two in most every category, including style, depth, color, and vividness."
3,"This is a decent ipod case, but I am not 100% thrilled with it. The best feature is the plastic cover that protects the video screen. It also has a nice texture. However, I had to cut a hole in the top of it in order to use the ""hold"" button (which is an extremely important ipod feature). Also, it collects a lot of dirt and it's impossible to keep the case clean. All in all, I think that it's good protection for the ipod, but I would not pay the $35 retail price for it."
3,"This is a good entry level video for the athlete who is feeling too tight and out of sync. The multiple variations are an excellant addition. Unquestionably, they will aid in balancing flexibility with strength which will aid in athletic performance. Rodney Yee is an excellent instructor. Proper attention is placed on the breath as is essential for true yoga. In as far as the conditioning workout that it promises, it falls short. One is better off with Brian Quest or similar videos.None the less this video has it's place and is a good starting place."
3,"Having read The Firm, The Rainmaker and enjoying both, I tackled The Chamber with great ferosity. I found the book easy to read in the fact that it kept me turning pages. I thought the character development was good for Adam, but not as good for Sam. I guess it depends on the focus of the book, but which character is the focus on ?? I felt the ending left a little to be desired, and quite frankly, I put the book down wanting more... too many loose ends, Rollie Wedge, his aunt etc etc...However, I must say it was a good read and an eye-opener to some of the myths and tradgies of the Death Penalty."
3,"""The Last Castle"" was the only entry from Jerry Goldsmith in 2001. 'The Castle' is a noble militaristic theme played on the trumpet by the gifted Malcolm McNab; it sounds a little bit like ""Patton"", but its noble feeling makes it catchy. The theme is fully developed on 'September 11, 2001', a elegiac cue which Goldsmith dedicated to those tragic events that occured on that infamous date. The action tracks are interesting, but somehow they don't quite reach the level of those from something like ""Total Recall"". However, the elegiac music is worth the price of this CDThe two songs are the only real lowdown of this CD, especially John Hammond's 'Get Behind The Mule'. So repetitive and boring. Personally I think this album would have worked better without the songs."
3,"While this set presents plenty of very interesting NASA produced documentaries, its image quality leaves much to be desired. It is understandable that most videos are more than 30 years old, so one can't expect DV like resolutions. However, the image quality in the first 4 discs is at best comparable to a typical VHS tape.The 5th disc -- which covers the ISS and recent shuttle flights such as John Glenn's and Columbia's disaster -- has better video, but it's still similar to a PAL video broadcast. So while the content is unique to DVD series, be aware that the transfer leaves much to be desired. If you're hoping to find high resolution footage of the space vehicles in all their glory (as I was), this shortcoming may be quite disappointing.As an unrelated note, my set had no region encoding. This is reasonable since NASA material is released to the public domain and shouldn't be published in a restricted format."
3,"I was expecting more of this product, but it was not all that. It does not help my kid float, it is practically useless for kids who cannot swim (and swim GOOD) yet."
3,"A good affordable digital multimeter under $10 will do the same job ,even better at troubleshooting a bad alt/battery,but all in all a decent tool for a quick check."
3,"Grate item, except for one unfortunate quality of all current li-ion rechargeable batteries. Fully charged, battery offers 4.23V! It was enough to burn couple of Nichia white LEDs, wreck hawock with LED emitter flashlight driver, and even seriously incapacitate Nikon SLR camera! When manually discharged to about 4V (probably to 2/3 of total capacity) all came to normal. So, be aware, this is 4.23 - 3.6 V battery!"
3,"I WAS PRETTY MUCH PLANNING TO FAST FORWARD THROUGH THIS MOVIE LOOKING FOR ""GOOD"" PARTS.BUT I ENDED UP WATCHING IT AT NORMAL SPEED BECAUSE ITS ALL GOOD PARTS.THE ACTING WAS SUPERB AND THE STORY UNFOLDS WITH A STRANGE RHYTHM.I'M AWARE THE STORY IS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS BUT I THOUGHT THE VIOLENT CLIMAX WAS JUST WRONG.DESPITE ALL THE LEAKY FAUCET TENSION BUILDING SCENES I FELT A HAPPY ENDING COMING ON.I WAS THINKING THE SISTERS WERE GONNA TELL THE OLD FRENCH BROAD TO TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT AND THEN MOVE TO CANADA OR SOMETHING.THEY DIDN'T."
3,obviously court tv wanted to be the first to make a movie about the whole scott peterson affair and they succeeded admirably...however they could have 1. waited until the outcome of the trial 2. re-enacted what if was like when laci was alive. There is nothing about laci in the whole movie which I think is pretty damned odd. I think much time was spent focusing in on Scott Peterson but is sociopathic tendencies are left out and had there been more time that went by we could see a more accurate movie with inclusion of everyone that was involved. I liked the movie but didn't see it until after the trial...I think we need a do-over.
3,"I took this product for a month. It was easy to swallow, it did have an odor but not so bad that I couldn't take it. I just didn't notice any real improvement that this product would have responsible for. But as with anything your experience may be different."
3,"This is a huge Sci Fi production and it is quite good too.Good points: it's long enough to be true to the book, with no glaring mistakes; costume design is excelent; set design and construction is excelent; the worms are VERY cool. The fat baron and the princess characters have character; this movie is almost too good for TV.Bad points: terrible casting; William Hurt disappears in the first fifth of the series; William Hurt does a bad acting job; bad acting jobs all around except fot the fat baron and the princess; you can distinguish the blue screen from the set in some scenes; this movie is not good enough to appear in theaters."
3,"Nothing special. Nina appears only a couple of times, no interviews. I bought it for the Nina's ""primary contributor"" note. Interesting anyway but not for Nina's contribution."
3,"Maeve Binchy is becoming one of my favorite authors. Evening Class is the 4th Binchy book I have read, but it is not the typical Binchy book compared to Circle of Friends, Glass Lake and Echoes. I was left not really knowing the characters. Because there were so many characters, Binchy was not able to fully develop them. I did not walk away feeling like I really can relate to any of the characters. The storytelling part of the book is very grand. Binchy is truly a master to interweave so many characters together. My next one will be Light a Penny Candle!"
3,"It was interesting.Visually very satisfying. The story is sad, though another similar subject, Zorba the Greek, was much more powerful, this film certainly was well done."
3,"Although I love Twinkie's vocal ability and song-writing skills, this cd is not one of her best performances. I guess I'm still stuck on the vintage Clark Sister sound!"
3,"Needed a small fryer to quickly cook tater tots and fish sticks for the kids.Pros: The fryer heats quickly and it doesn't take up much space on the counter.Cons: kinda hard to see the temp numbers on the dial. You have to stoop down to counter hight to read them. My biggest problem with this fryer is its difficult to clean. The metal liner inside the unit is not removable. What this means is you have to very carefully hand wash the fryer, making sure you don't get anything but the interior of the fryer wet. Kind of a hassle. I wish it was removable and the next time around if this one quits working I'd buy one with a removable interior metal liner."
3,"I received a Kindle DX for XMas and am not entirely happy with the content available for downloading. The last 4 books I tried to purchase were not available in Kindle format. What is going on with Kindle? Really, really disappointing!"
3,I was disappointed in the imprint the pan left on my cookies. I thought the pan's non-stick qualities were good and my cookies did not burn. I just wanted to see the imprint more!
3,"These heel cups provided some relief from plantar fasciitis pain, not terrific. I found they were not as effective as HTP heel cups."
3,"I can't say that this CD is good or bad, because it isn't either. It had some songs that are really nice, pretty, and harmonic, like the type Jewel sings. Then it has some of a funkier nature, that you can really dance to. But some of the songs are just total losers. They just put you to sleep like lullabies. They say nothing, they mean nothing, and they are nothing, except junk. The songs you hear on the radio are only the best of her works, so even if you like one song, you should hear ALL of them before buying the CD. But I'm not saying it's all bad, because some of the songs on this CD are very cool and very pleasant."
3,like a previous reviewer stated..the lid is not hollow so you are limited in what you can put in the tray.. Its an OK tool box but for what I paid..I think it is not worth the money after seeing some tool boxes at a local famous store that is known for it's tools..
3,"Loved the sound quality for several months, especially for the amount they cost. However, the wiring is starting to give out on them now. I've got to jiggle the cord and fiddle with the connector to get sound out of both headphones. It's a common problem for any headphones, so I'm not too disappointed given the price."
3,"as title said; its a low end chicago cutlery product- You got what you pay for, steak knifes are not sharp at all, Cheff knife is also not sharp, other two are. Caddy is good looking. I essentially paid for ""chi cutlery"" name otherwise this quality can be purchased for same amount (other brands),I have no complaint of buying two at 17.75$each but the quality is low hence 3 star for product"
3,"I was a bit disappointed with Jump's newest offering... The swirling, effect laden guitars and double tracked vocals are a far cry from the good old days of ""Licorice Tea Demos"".The title track and ""Rains in Asia"" are both pretty good. The new single ""Young America"" is pretty weak, as is the rest of the album.Here's to hoping that ""Between the Dim and the Dark"" grows on me over time..."
3,"The author offers interesting perspective to our eternal soul, and some of the passages in the Bible - especially about Jesus. He does contradict his position about Mediums and ""cold readings"" at certain points in the book, but all-in-all this is a good book - worth the price."
3,"This is definitely better than ""The Real Cool Killers,"" but isn't the best crime novel in the 20th Century. Thank goodness others such as Walter Mosley built off Himes' craft."
3,"Just thought I would throw my two cents worth in, we live in Florida and we have all ceramic tiled flooring and it was quite a job cleaning the tiles with a mop and bucket so we decided to purchase something that would do the job with a little less effort. It does make the job cleaning the tiles a lot easier definitely! It reduces your work load to about half, there is work involved and a learning curve to get use to of when to apply the cleaner and how long to go over an area.I would give this a thumbs up though and it seems to be a good product.Be prepared to dump the water periodically because it seems to fill up quick. Does not do any magic to grout though, but the cleaning solution for grout does work if you go over and over it!"
3,"Really loved the premise, (Classic Fairy Tales + Detective Noir) but I was taken out of the story quite a bit by inconsistent writing.Many of the characters just did not resonate at all with me (The dialog wasn't good, but got a little better as it went).I'm thinking this gets much better as it goes on as most friends who recommended it said this first one was the weakest.The pencils were fairly good---though I thought the coloring could have been done better through out.I'm off to check out the next trade."
3,"Great in what the company says it does, but be prepared for the noise. Most of the noise appears to be produced by the fan which blows very strongly. Inexplicably, it seems there are only two fan settings: stronger and strongest. Engineering to avoid noise producing turbulent flow may also help. The grills of my two units also do not turn down due to poor fitting, either a design flaw or a production error.On the other hand, customer service is great! The vinyl window kits did not fit my narrow windows, and they quickly sent me the foam ones for free."
3,"~~~Tuck Everlasting is a very magical and creative book. In the beginning I thought it could be a little more suspenseful but as you read on, it became more interesting. While I read this book it made me wonder how it would actually be like living forever. At the beginning of the book I mostly thought that is was cool knowing you could see the future but what about all my friends, soon they would pass away and you would always look the same. I think this book was a pretty good book because it made you think about what would happen if you were in there position. I would recommend reading this book to little children because it is very magical and exciting. I also like this book because you could never predict what was really going to happen next.~~~"
3,"Few Americans realize that native American children were shipped away to eastern schools to be civilizedjust as the children Australian aborigines. The pattern of trying to break the chain of culturein subject peoples is very common in the pattern of empires.Here we have an Australian cattle baron trying subdue his competition.An English Lady finds her husband dead and a cattle drive is necessary to save thestation. ""Drover"" is her answer. After the cattle drive success they settle in to awet and dry cycle until the Japanese invade and the young mixed breed boy ( a creamy)is sent to a mission school on an island.The end result is full of suspense and romance.In the end a family of survivors results.I liked the movie, but somehow the acting and script isn't good enough thatlove the good guys and hate the bad guys?"
3,"Joan Ryan seems to possess the ability and talent of an above average songstress. A bought this CD over six months ago, and after giving it a couple of playings, I have lost interest in it. Considering the number of discs I have that I like to play frequently, I would have to say that this production goes into the dispensable category. Not that I would call it bad or a disaster, it just doesn't belong on the ""exceptional"" list."
3,"This story is about two guys who are itinerant workers,that look for work in ranches.They always travel togethter and always get in troubleand get fired. George who is the main charachter always helps Lennie and tries to solve his problems.'Cause you got me to look after you and you to look after me'. I think that the book deals mostly about Loneliness. All is related to loneliness even the place where they work 'Soledad'. It is suitable for all ages who understand the vocabulary.I liked this book because it is very intereting and emotive"
3,A good production. The cinematics and special effects improved the documentary immensely. I wish that there was a little more depth as to how the muslims rose to power in the middle east before the crusades. It would help to clarify the christian views of why going to war was considered necessary. Also a bit more balance of the christian point of view vs. the muslim point of view would have been nice.
3,I have had the Braun kf 600 for about 6 months and it makespretty good coffee but for one problem: the basket has a tendancyto swing open during the brewing cycle. The pushbutton basket release and the spring loaded basket is really overkill and notat all neccessary for convenience. I have spoken with braunabout the design and they have agreed to replace the machine.This is a classic case of not sticking to the traditional manualbasket operation for a sales gimmic that has no added value.
3,"...this book really helps put this famous through the eyes of someone else other than CNN reporters. Amber Frey's prose may not be that of a literary genius, it's a good fast read. If anyone thought the same way I did, then they would have thought that Amber Frey was some horrible woman trying to break up the Petersons' marriage, but that wasn't the case at all. For those who are absolutely fascinated by famous court cases such as this, than this book is for you. If you are absolutely sick to death of hearing about the Peterson trial, don't pick this book up.One last thing, it's good but not so great to pay the hardcover price. Wait for paperback."
3,"This book is worth reading--for the ideas and themes if not for the story. I've read other Asimov works (The Foundation Trilogy is one of my favorite series of all time), but this one seemed stretched thin, possibly because it was co-authored.The first third of this book, up until Nightfall, is chilling and thrilling. The second half wanders, and though I don't want to give anything away, has a very anticlimactic ending. After finishing it, I felt the last section 'Daybreak"" could have been left off almost completely and the novel would have actually benefitted.Some of the ideas in the novel should have been further developed, while others, especially a quasi-romance subplot, made the story drag in places.To sum things up, the first half or so is excellent, true to Asimov-form. The second half is boring, disappointing, and un-Asimov. For a 5 star start and a 1 star finish, I give 3 stars. I would be interested to know who wrote which parts of this book."
3,"I don't know why panasonic cannot add automatic voltage conversion ($10 feature) in a medium-to-high level shaver. Remington has it in most models, while panasonic has only very few models supporting it.If you travel internationally, you need to buy a remington converter (mostly bought by panasonic customers)."
3,"Lots of strong reviews and an enjoyment of the odd British mystery led me to think I would like this better than I did. Sort of plodded my way through it. Surprised and disappointed in the first 4/5ths, and honestly, a bit confused as to why. Wanted to weigh in on ""stars"". Might give it an extra half star for the last fifth."
3,"This thing was ok, but for me, hard to follow. It sort of seemed a bit disjointed. Dispite what it says on the cover, Christina was NOT back after Thriller as this Movie was made before Thriller. This would probably be better suited as a rental, as you will probably only want to see it once."
3,Recommended with a 15 amp electric snow blower. Cord reel rated at 100 ft. Not if 12/3 wire. Expected reel to be larger.
3,"It was damaged when I received it. It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my Boss. I tried to glue it where it came apart but it didn't work out that well, I was disappointed."
3,"Brehm and his colleagues train hard and perform extraordinary, dangerous rescues. They should be commended for their selfless work and are obviously heroes. That Others May Live is an account of Brehm's life during a few notable rescues. The chapter on the Mount McKinley adventure is well written and exciting. There are plenty of insights into Brehm's inner thoughts and emotions as a rescuer, as a husband and as a family man.However, having read many excellent first person military accounts, I am disappointed in this book. It could have been so much more. Perhaps something got lost in the audio version. If you are looking for gripping, detailed and action packed adventures, I would suggest that you read the excellent books by Andy McNab, Cameron Spence, Chris Ryan and Mike Curtis."
3,"I have had this pedometer for three weeks and enjoy the fact it is easy to use and read and that it records the past 7 days of walking. However, my big complaint is that it falls off. When I wear it with thinner pants, like yoga pants, it is fine, however, when I clip it on pants with thicker fabric at the waist, it pops off. This has happened about 5 times, all while wearing jeans. If you plan to wear this regularly with jeans, you may want to look for a different model."
3,"I purchased this product to be able to play my ipod at work and other places like hotels. It's good for those reasons. The sound is not very good. The inserts do not work. When I try to put my ipod nano in the proper insert it doesn't connect, but when I take the insert out, it works just fine. If you're looking for something that sounds great, this is not the right purchase for you, but the price kind of makes up for the rest."
3,"I'm not bashing 28 Weeks Later because I did find it entertaining and slightly creepy. However I am going to say I did feel it dragged on quite a bit. There were times where I found myself pretty bored and hoping it was going to pick up. I know sequels usually don't measure up to the original so I'm not really going to compare the two. I do feel it would be worth a rental to see for yourself, but you probably won't be blown away."
3,"I am dissatified,the chair that I ordered was a burgundy chair and they sent me a black chair."
3,"I haven't given it to her yet, so I guess I can't tell you how good the necklace is. But it was a great deal. The picture is much bigger than the actual size. Pay attention to the dimensions."
3,"Shape Pilates Workout: Makeover Your Your Abs, Butt and Thighs Fast!I have another Lizbeth Garcia's Pilates DVD and because i liked that one so much, i bought this one. I have to say i wasn't impressed with this DVD. There is more emphasis on the thighs and a little bit on the butt, but there is not much for the abs. There are also two girls doing the workout with her but you can see how they start to sham towards the end. I recommend her ""Pilates on the ball"" DVD more than this one: )"
3,"So, I loved this toy, I thought it was the cutest thing. Alas, my son has never really played with it. He's more of a ""wooden-toy"" kid, he has never really gravitated to anything soft. But if your child likes soft toys, give this a whirl. It's well-made, durable, and the characters all make different noises. You have to push and pull to get the animals in and out of the fishbowl - it takes a bit of force."
3,"Just got this in Dec. assembly wasn't difficult although instructions were less than clear. Very light weight (slides all over a hardwood floor without tethering or non-slip pad). Works good with a nice smooth motion. There is no tension adjustment, just the fan resistance and the digital readout is rudimentary at best. With rowing machines you really do get what you pay for and this machine is the best one I have run across under $300. Folds up (which is a bit more complicated than it could be) for storage. It is a bit louder than some others but not really loud, just the fan noise with each pull. Great exercise, despite slightly light resistance for me I can get a decent cardio workout in less than an hour with the machine."
3,"No complaints with the qulity of the recordings. The first CD in the set is really wonderful, because I love crooners. After that, his style was changed a great deal by what I think of as popular competition with other rock singers and I don't care for the singing nearly as much. Having said that, this is just my personal taste, so other people might be very pleased with the whole set."
3,"This product was a welcome addition to our existing security system. It worked great for about two month. Suddenly it started ""going off"" all the time; then it completely died. We only used it for about 4 months. So sad, it's still mounted on our tree as a deterrent... haha!"
3,I used this product mainly at night. My husband snores and it did help me to sleep somewhat better. I really don't think this product has any advantages over similar products on the market.
3,"I found that this radio is a decent buy, but it doesnt have a strong enough receiver to really do what you want it to do unless you mount it on the dash or even closer to the antenna. I have a subaru and a mazda, and the ""antenna-less"" cars like the new subarus are not x-act friendly. Personally, I suggest the Sirius One radio over this unit, as it packs more power and simplicity - for $25!Additionally, the remote on the xact receiver is all wacked out - makes it hard to juggle stations if you want to change while driving."
3,well this isn't the Bishops Wife... but it is a passable entertainment ! on the DVD you have the choice of colorized or original black and white i say go black and white cause the colorized sometimes comes across as too dark the special effects are passable for the age of the film and after a while i stopped thinking about the gypsy woman in the WOLF MAN every timw Maria popped on to the screen ! and you will too interesting extras too include Bob Hope and Bette Davis for vintage war bond and christmas seals comercials - a bit of like a time travel back to world war two times at the movies ?movie trailers and deleted scenes ! worth the cheap price under 10 bucks i hear !
3,"great remote but buy the model that is two down on logitechs website, the back lighting is weak on this model making it difficult to see the numerals and words, the lesser model is more clearly lit and easier to use"
3,"I didn't expect a ""real"" carnival claw machine, I knew it would be plastic and maybe not perfect AND I wasn't disappointed with that expectation. It came with the left to right action not working. Usually this kind of thing is a matter of a short or a pinched wire - so I took all those little screws out and and tested each wire. yep, one was pinched off - I repositioned, tested it again, hot glued it down and put it back together. It works Ok for what we bought it for - a Carnival themed site at a music festival. The music is annoying but hey, it's a game and stops when it runs out of time or you win, whichever first so it's livable. Not bad for the $, but if I didn't know how to fix it, I would have been really ticked off - they need to quality check the items before packaging and shipping. REALLY, how hard is that????"
3,"Sometimes it was hard to keep reading even though I love this author.It was still far from bad. Though I will warn those who know nothing about Faulkner, it is not a warm fuzzy story."
3,"I love Jack Lemmon. Love Judy Holiday. But together...in this movie anyway...a dud. I blame it on the script. It was not smart, clever, or in the least imaginative. I was bored most of the time, but I stuck with it and watched it all the way through. It reminded me of so many movies of the era. That was the problem. It seemed to take twists from other movies and mesh them all together into one film. But judge for yourself. It was great seeing these fine comedics again. I just wish the movie had more going for it than the yawn syndrome."
3,"I've had my grill over a year now and I really did like it and I usedit all the time. Then one day the cooking surface started bubbling. Icalled the company and they refused to help because they are only warranted for 1 year, after that you have to buy a new one. If I have to buy a new one then I'll buy the Cooks Essentials Grill...because it's warranty is lifetime."
3,"Despite ""Zombie Birdhouse"" is not precisely Iggy's best work, it is one of his most weird, eccentric and curious releases in his solo career. Maybe it's not perfect but it's an album that grows on you and showed that Iggy was an artist with great creativity who shifted easily from one musical style to another. Unfortunately, the album is too confusing and ambitious and becomes a bit monotonous after the first three songs. The lyrics are also slightly uninspired and do not add too much to this particular release. Buy it only if you are an Iggy's die-hard fan, if not, you probably won't find anything of interest in this bizarre experiment."
3,"I ordered this product because it was advertised as light-weight and easy to assemble. The photo looked as if the dog inside would have good visibility to the outside.The crate is not easy to assemble and requires strength. While not terribly heavy (22 lbs), it is heavy given the bulkiness of the crate. The weight makes assembly harder. The netting is so dark in color that there is not good visibility for the animal inside; instead it is kind of claustrophobic. I returned the crate."
3,"If, and it is a big IF, you never encounter any inaccuracies with this product, it is an acceptable product. On the other hand, if you encounter one, and you contact the publisher about it, expect to be ignored. In my case, I attempted to route a trip from Tok, AK to Destruction Bay, CAN. I was routed many miles in a round about fashion. I tried to use the Draw function to introduce the most direct route but that failed also. The response from Tech Support was that I could return it for a refund if I had owned it 30 days or less. So, buyer beware!"
3,"I've owned this for 4-5 months now. I've been challenged in getting the cadence and speed sensors to pick up and can't seem to figure it out. First of all, the cadence sensor has to be real close to the magnet on the crank, but they don't give you enough rubber padding to make this work, so I had to rig my own thing--then I lost the magnet on the crank and it hasn't worked for months. I suppose I could replace it, but it kind of ticks me off. Lately, the speed sensor is going in and out and I can't seem to figure out why. The magnet on the wheel is right next to the sensor, but it doesn't pick up and then when I'm riding, it will just start to work. Maybe it's the cold weather, because this wasn't a problem all summer. Anyway, this computer is OK, but I'll probably buy a different one next spring."
3,"Giving it three stars for the music. I'm afraid the movie itself hasn't stood the test of time. The story line is typical for a farce/spoof, but the script lets it down badly.I remember it being so much funnier - but then the last time I saw it was when it first came out. Despite the disappointment with this aspect of the dvd, I must say it was worth every penny for the music. Took me back to their glory days - and mine. If you love their music, buy it and disregard the movie - you just can't get dvd's of their concerts, and if you could all you'd be able to hear would be screaming anyway."
3,"This would have been a very interesting movie - addressing very neatly what the appeal was of the Charles Boyer-look-alike, which was a mystery to reviewers of other movies based on the real story of the Lonely Hearts Club killers. I liked this movie except for the ending, which (a) departs from the real story upon which the movie is based, and (b) seems to me a very awkward edit to make the story end after X number of minutes despite great injury to the story or plot.I deleted the paragraph in which I say what the ending was, since 0 of 1 people found my review helpful, perhaps that was the unhelpful part. And yet this review was popping up as the most helpful critical review despite others rated more helpful and more critical, so go figure ... maybe a little glitch.The rest of what I would have to say is already covered in the previous 5 reviews. I googled the Lonely Hearts Club Murders and read with interest Mark Gado's 23 page article. (small pages)"
4,Good shoes. I like it because I tend to sweat in my feet with other shoes but not this one. I even wear it to my office. Recommend it.
4,Great Movie! I got this tin box set for $24.96 from Walmart. How can these people charge so much here at AMAZON?
4,"Even though the book was written some time ago, the conclusions re: emotional and psychological ""tolls"" of being gifted remain accurate. I would recommend reading the open letter to the parents of gifted children that appears at the end of the book first - you realize immediately that you are not alone, but that in our culture it is not acceptable to discuss, or God forbid complain, about any aspects of your child's giftedness."
4,"The author is an expert when providing criticism that is interwoven into his narrative. I was drawn to this book bcause I read his short stories and because of the criticism by certain religious groups. What I find most interesting is that this book is not easy to read and the remarks he makes are not blatant. More than anything, you can easily find yourself bored at times when reading this book. No author in the world should be able to trigger any group this literally. ---Get something else to do. Go to a movie. Get laid. There is nothing here that couldnt be discounted the same way as changing the channel on the TV."
4,"Exercise starts out slowly, builds to a point where you are working up a sweat and then gradually comes back down again without a prolonged period of maximum effort. Short sets of light aerobics are alternated with sets of toning exercises, some using free weights, a tall box, (I use my two-step Rubbermaid footstool) and a dowel. (I use an expandable shower curtain rod.)You can improvise equipment based on what you have around your house. There are lots of squats, lunges and dips so quads and hamstrings get the most toning benefits. The last exercise on the tape is a great shaper for the upper hamstring area. Exercises are done in low-rep sets so they are mangageable and the tape moves along quickly. I like the tape and have recommended it to my sister (who has been doing the same Jane Fonda tape for more than 5 years!)"
4,"from CD Roots: A rare mix of traditional Korean music with a modern American sensibility that includes Robert Dick on flutes; Thomas Buckner, baritone; National Living Treasure Chung Jae-Guk, Park Jong-Sol and Yang Myung-Sok on piri; as well as Joseph Celli playing the oboe and English horn. With this new release, Jin Hi Kim champions the cause of cross-cultural communication through four unique compositions that skirt, weave and dart across and between Asian-American microtonal sound chambers. The results are at once spiritual, artistic and illuminating--decidedly Korean, and subtly American. Jin Hi Kim's LivingTones ushers in a new era of East-West aesthetic understanding through the creation of a new place where subcultural investigations are allowed occur and grow freely."
4,Beautiful arrangements... you will love this if you loved Hips and Makers.
4,"The manuscript at the end is illegible on my eReader. Having gotten a hard copy from the library, it is still hard reading as Patrick O'Brian's penmenship is difficult to read. I LOVE HIS ""GIFT of words"" to the world...and I will again begin sailing through his 1-20 novels, again and again. May you, too, enjoy his gift."

4,"The average serious, life-long horror fan has probably seen the majority of the films covered in this book (I definitely have). What I really liked about reading this was the trivia the author managed to dig up about each movie. Definitely a good reference guide, as the titles listed here will ALWAYS be worth recommending to someone else. In an age where most movie-goers don't venture past the new release section, there can't be enough books like this out there."
4,"Movie was is good condition...not new like add had said, but works well. Should word advertisement differently so no misunderstanding"
4,"We're a middle aged couple who carefully research large purchases and long term contracts before we commit. We think cell phone contracts, as a group, are terribly unfair to consumers, but, in that group, Verizon may be the best - you need to look for coverage areas and what's best for you - if you live along the East Coast and do all your calling in that area, then Verizon is the clear favorite, look out if you live in Northern Oregon or in Appleacia, roaming changes there are real high - we almost never go over our allotted minutes and are satisfied with Verizon. Other companies have poorer (less) ""free time"" and more add-on charges (buyer beware)"
4,"This book brings together quite a bit of new information about early satellite imaging in general and Corona in particular. It covers many interesting political, technical, military and personal aspects of the subject. The author combines information already in the public domain with new information from sources who have spoken with him now that the program has officially come out of the ""black world"". It is heartily recommended for anyone interested in the development of military space technology but is also a fine source for those who are mainly interested in Cold War politics. Hats off to anyone reading this who was involved in Corona. You folks did a lot to make sure the good guys won!"
4,I love this pad.. but a good web search finds other latex pads in more softness values and less expensive
4,Biomimicry gives an insight into where future technology could take us without getting too technical on it's explainations. Benyus takes us into a variety of different natural world arenas and shows us how scientists are working to use millions of years of evolution in our everyday lives. Mother Nature is a smart cookie. We all should listen.
4,"Great movie, although you have to pay attention to details, its really fun for those who want suspense."
4,"Sandi Patty's voice is powerful, clear, and full ranged. If you love big church like productions, this CD is for you."
4,"Great effect,Sound is amazing .Only on thing I would change ,is the covering if you have a heavy foot the peddle is not going to with stand getting kicked on and off alot before the plastic breaks ..Danelectro isa great company I have used there peddles for a while.One thing to change would be a durable cover,(steel) ten the peddl would be perfect.."
4,"""The Hero and the Outlaw"" provides a structured, intelligent, logical way to firstly categorise brands and then secondly to understand them.The text is readable, sufficiently academic to provide credibility and clarity, while practical enough to provide the basis for understanding brands in all types of businesses.That said, it is not a once-through read, but rather should be seen as a text book to which to refer, to keep own brand on point, as well as to understand the behaviours of brands with whom your company may do business."
4,"We bought for a one year old to play with onthe fridge, so we are happy to see that the magnets are pretty well secured. We took out some of the smaller letters which could be a choking hazard. These ARE NOT rated for kids that age, so we use only when supervised."
4,"I bought this text for class and find that it is a helpful text for introductory studies of eschatology, the study of the end times"
4,"When I first listened to this CD, I was a little surprised Neil Diamond strayed pretty much from his usual ""soft side"" and went for a harder techno-pop sound here. This is not a bad CD to say the least, and many of the heavily synthesized tracks provide a welcomely refreshing change of pace in songs like the title track ""Headed For The Future"", ""Stand Up For Love"", and the Stevie Wonder penned ""Lost In Hollywood"", on which Stevie provides the keyboards. This CD also has its melancholy side with tracks like ""The Man You Need"" and ""It Should Have Been Me"", as well as sentimental tracks (""I'll See You On The Radio) Laura"" and ""Me Beside You"". The techno-pop, synthesized sound is alone worth the price of this CD. Even true Diamond fans will want to add it to their collection. A must buy!"
4,Works great. Just what I needed to trim grass around other tender plants where a line trimmer would destroy the plants.
4,"I work on several motorcycles at my home. I like the apron for keeping by clothes clean, but also for the extra pockets for holding tools and parts while working. The split in the front makes it easy to bend down and not be constrained by the apron. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the latch for the waste is a little hard to reach since it is not in the front."
4,"Anyone intersted in the graphic stylism, the stark imagery, the sometimes disturbing and sometimes hilarious generalizations made in American Propaganda during World War Two should check out this book. It contains many posters that I've not seen in print before, but unfortunately leaves many others out. From an academic, historical perspective the documentation and historical explanations for the U.S. propaganda machine are too brief. Still, the poster reproductions are fantastic, mostly in color. I would also reccomend Anthony Rhodes ""Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion"" for a look at other countries' propaganda from the same time period."
4,"It is a welcome breath of fresh air, to finally read an unbiased, unsolicited opinion of this sad blot on American gothic suburbia. As a former resident of the county and state under examination, and someone who attended the trial, it is very refreshing to find someone not swayed by the histrionics that the family of the convicted murderer so diligently deploy. Ms. Davis' review of the trial is unerring, and ultimately this is what matters most...not Darlie's supporters' unverified claims of new evidence and ""shocking untold stories."" I doubt that this review will earm me much more than a ton of unwanted email, but it must be said that this book, as part of the Darlie Routier canon, finally lays the question to rest for any person of reason and rationality. I have no doubt that Darlie Kee can find all manner of falsehoods and dis-information here, but if she didn't, her new career as a talk show victim would be over, then, wouldn't it?"
4,"This was a great read because it is refreshing to see a woman who was born into the demimonde and still aspire to be ""normal"". I like the view of the world from the mother and her friends who try to make Gabrielle accept passion and not marriage. The seduction attempts were both interesting and touching at the same time. All in all, a good value for your money and definitely not a waste of time to read."
4,"Hi - I am the author of this book, and I want to make sure everyone understands where this book comes from. It's parts of three different books, with several new chapters. It's fairly beginner-ish in nature, but you definitely have to have a handle on how the Web works, from an administrative standpoint, to get your brain around the Apache chapters. The MySQL and PHP chapters assume less pre-existing knowledge, and are pretty fun, hands-on and oriented through working through lessons.This is not the be all and end all PHP, Apache and MySQL book -- that would take way longer than 24 hours -- nor is it meant to be. But it will teach the fundamentals of all three things, and provide you with a strong foundation for more advanced books. You can find more info like table of contents, code and errata at thickbook.com.Best, Julie."
4,"It is a must have item for those babies who touch everything and put their fingers right to their mouth! I agree the 1st review said barrier of all germs. We bought this when my daughter was 9 months, she is 15 months now, we are still using it to go shopping. It is definite worth to invest for a cart seat!"
4,this is a great game.the graphics are awsome.you probably couldn't beat this game without the strategy guide.but this is the best game on xbox!
4,"Walter Cronkites' book ""A Reporters Life"" is interesting, irrelevant and ultimately depressing. His behind the scenes view of some of the most important events of this decade where interesting and exciting. Wannabe journalists beware, you may get caught up in the excitement of by gone days and start reconsidering that career change. The book goes off track when Mr. Cronkites turns from journalist to OP-Ed writer. Mr. Cronkite offers up personal opinion as if he is reporting history. Ultimately the book is depressing in its view of the current state of journalism, depressing because of the truth in his words. Thanks Mr. Cronkite for telling us the ""way it was"""
4,"Didn't get the colors I had expected on these. The picture and description lead me to believe that the ""bright"" more vibrant variety of the folders would be delivered - the lime green, bright pink, etc. Not so. The ones I received were the plain red, green, blue, yellow, and orange. It may seem picky, but when you base your filing on a specific set of colors, it's diappointing none the less.Still good quality folders, just not what I had expected."
4,Reading this book in the least will cause you analyze and self scrutinize the way you manage your time and efforts in your career. It is a wealth of information and should be slowly digested.
4,This was an easy way to order and insure we had enough TP for our trip. 4 of 5 stars because the product is less expensive at Wal Marts in their RV section.
4,"""No Salutes for Surrender"" is a great mystery novel. Allowing for the small mistakes of a young and new writer the book was excellent. It was particulary interesting to those of us who have visited the area Antanas talks about. My Lithuanian friends were particularly interested in the book also.Congratulations to Anatanas for a fine peice of work."
4,Love the new/different sounds of Christina's latest albumFavorite tracks:Disc 1:3. Back in the Day7. Oh MotherDisc 2:1-36. Hurt9. The Right Man
4,"Overlooking the massive size of this printer and the lack of an auto 4x6 tray, this printer is awesome. Very pleased with this purchase."
4,"Professional drummer with 27 years playing. I've never been a fan of too many splashes but the Wuhan did not disappoint. I have it mounted on a stacker post and it performs well. Not too tinny and degrades quickly. With any splash you must have finesse, hit it like you slap your ham and you'll dent it."
4,"A cappela madrigals about the unfortunate demises of a variety of doomed peasents. The songs are full of strikingly poetic betrayal, murder, forboding dreams, ghosts, stabbing, hanging. Lines like ""High above the wedding guests, he hung the ashes of her wedding dress"" and ""If he was fire, she must be wood"" abound.The ridiculous contrast between the sweet vocals and grotesque lyrics by itself is entertaining enough to justify buying this album."
4,"PHONOGRAPH DIARYSPOKEN BY VAN HELSINGNovember 8 - Ooh...for a long time during my old age he remain yonder, as Friend Quincey would say, but now he swell up at thought of Madam Lucy and Madam Mina together. He...Mein Gott! I did not realize I was recording!This is the story of courageous men, woman with man-brain, and undead with child-brain. From Transylvania to London and back on ship, our heroes traverse much to rid the world of unrelenting evil, a most fractious beast. However, I stop now, though my impulse tells me to disclose more, I tell him no."
4,"These covers are a little snug for my hybrid irons, but they serve the purpose. Not as flexible as I expected."
4,"From a non-viewer of the weekly serious, I found this movie easy to follow and extremely entertaining! The movie kept me on my seat too, and I will have to admit made me jump a few times. This is a get me if I have ever seen one. The only problem, where is the DVD?"
4,I have Joanie Greggains step workout which is just ok. This Back Health workout is really very good. It is slow and easy to follow but forces you to watch technique. It incorporates a lot of abs and upper leg workout. The workout is about 30 minutes. There is a section at the end where a doctor talks about back health - I haven't watched that part. I thought this tape was well worth the money.
4,This book was so touching. I have read his books and love his style of writing. I appreciate his so openess about his relationship with God. He also revealed his life story and the openess of his struggles and losses. His solid marrage father and his brother holds testimony to living wiithin his beliefs.
4,"The book is very helpful, filled with not only the verb conjugations and meanings, but examples, as well. Five hundred and one verbs will get you pretty far in most languages. The only ding against this book, and it's an important one for anyone who has been reading Hebrew for more than a few months is that it is written English style, from left to right, opening with the binding to the left. This can really mess with your mind when you're trying to find a word! By the time you're ready for a reference like this, you're familiar with the alef bet and have probably used a few Hebrew dictionaries. So, as you're looking a a word up, you start with alef and one and and expect tav and the other and look words up in the middle according to that order. It would be helpful if the next version of the book were bound in the opposite direction."
4,"Honestly, I don't know that I should have purchased this... I found that I was much less prone to cutting myself if I was wearing a full leather glove on my non-carving hand. So, this doesn't really get much use anymore. Fortunately it was pretty cheap so no real loss. It gets the job done though if you don't want to cut your thumb."
4,This book came in time almost like a new. But this book is pocket size book with 20-30 pages. I did not expect this. May be I did not figure out from Amazon. Everything else is good expect this is smaller version.
4,"I like the font of this thesaurus. The font is reasonably big so that children can follow along - not like regular thesauruses that even I find difficult to read for long.What I didn't like was that the pictures were not that interesting. Often the drawings had very little to do with the text and was just an additive to, I guess, make the page pretty. Kids need to read something that attracts them, that keeps their attention, and pictures always do that.It is hardcover and has many, many words that are given and replaced with and so I do like the book. It is just a little below what I expected from scholastic books.For the money, however, I find that it is a great buy!"
4,"I am a 7th grader at Desert Ridge Middle School. I though that it was so so book. I think the best parts are when Ender's in battle school. However it is pretty violent. There are parts where Edner kicks people to death. while Ende'rs at battle school Graff turns Ender into a sick, dispersed, psychotic child. It's a good book"
4,"This canned mackerel is of very high quality, and it is caught sustainably. Some of the cans were dented, but not broken. The fish was too salty for my taste (>30% daily value for sodium per can !). I will go back to Vital Choice with no salt or Bar Harbor brand if I can find them."
4,This was worth the money I spent on it (not much). Nice big scoop... I have already found several uses for it in my kitchen (aside from using it with the wok). And my boyfriend claims he's going to confiscate it to use for an icefishing scoop. Hmmm.
4,"I had to come back to this book. Once I started to read ""In Due Time"" I could not wait for the narrator to talk to me again. Great story. Great characters and REAL characters. I look forward to more works by Mr Reynard."
4,There is nonstop action as well as a lot of graphic violence and graphic adult content it is not John Ringo's best work but it is still far better than 85% of the stuff out there.
4,"I am a dad with one expecting. This was good for understanding the womans side of the story, though not the other way, nor doea it help with any relationship megatives that may come, besides saying ""it will end"". Still very benficial read."
4,"Really good value for money, although it would be better if it had more than two heat settings. Great for getting knots out of wet hair."
4,"This game is just like cross version. Despite popular rumors you don't actually build your robots. You customize them with different colors, body designs, and weapons. I have both of these 2 versions and I personally like Cross better. The atributes of the robopon are more complicated than Pokemon types. If you like RPGs and customize-your-team games this is for you!! I don't recommend this for young gamers, it has too many possabilities and is a little hard to understand."
4,"I think James Earl Jones is just the man we need to read this. However, I'm sure that Gilbert Gottfried could do an excellent job as well. Let's all cross our fingers."
4,I enjoyed reading this selection. I found myself questioning if it is ever too late for a person to make a change in their life and find love. The characters touched me and I truly cared about their struggles.Good weekend read!
4,"Was taking a course on the Book of Revelation, and found this book a great resource and accessory study guide. The author walks you through each chapter and verse and even provides additional information in every-day terms. Recommend this book highly."
4,I bought this CD at a local store on a whim as it was in bargain section and I wasn't really expecting much. I sat up the moment the overture came on. The sound is completely acceptable considering the age of the recording (1944) and the interpretation is honest to goodness old school no-nonsense Beethoven. The singing is truly excellent without a single weak link. This is far preferable to the later recording Karl Bohm made in the 1960s with the Dresden Statskapelle and the squally Gwyneth Jones and unsteady James King. What's more the Leonore III overture is included (often ommited in many recordings. Listen in particular to the finale of Act 2 and many will agree that this even equals (and surpasses on many counts) the legendary Klemperer recording. A truly inspired and revelatory interpretation and for me a steal at the price!
4,"I stumbled upon this cd and made the connection with Bourgeois Tagg. I had enjoyed their ""Yoyo"" album so i bought this on a whim. So glad i did because i enjoyed it so much. I still pull it out of my cd collection every now and then. I have his second solo cd as well and although it has a more pop feel to it, i like it very much as well. I think he became ""born again"" because his 3rd cd is definately ""christian pop"". That's fine with me, but he lost me a bit going in that direction musically."
4,I love this product. I first started using it when my hair dresser used it on my hair. I love the shine it gives.
4,"First of all, as amazing as this was, it was not even CLOSE to the Star Wars trilogy...some who say it was just like Lucas...""playing with his toys"" are wrong because the Star Wars trilogy appeals to people of all ages...from grandchildren to grandparents. The LOTR trilogy is not for all audiences."
4,"This is, what, six years old? Still, for those of us who are kids at heart (and who grew up with monsters under the bed and in the closet), this is a very good rememberance of childhood, and a good tale for the kids of today that the ""bump in the night"" probably is a dream. I recommend it."
4,"The See It series is finally allowing Fodor's to compete with the Eyewitness Travel Guides from DK Publishing which are always full of photos plus 3-D maps and diagrams. It was extremely helpful during the online research and planning of an upcoming trip. Previously I would typically not buy a book from Fodor's since I prefer to both see and read about a destination that I would like to learn more about and plan to visit.The Rome book is well done with lots of useful photos, clear descriptions, maps, ratings, and even walking tours. They have done an excellent job and I recommend it as an alternative to DK Eyewitness and to supplement the Rick Steves' advice focused book. I wish this book wasn't so bulky as the pages are thick and the book is taller than the average title. Overall a good choice for a travel book about Rome for the first or second time visitor."
4,"Bought this CD after not having listened to Dio for a while (The rest of my Dio-collection consists of vinyl records), and I must say, there was pleasant sounds in my living room! Of course, there was nostalgy involved, but the music in itself rocks too. One or two more songs from the Dream Evil-album, and I would have given 5 stars."
4,i really enjoyed this book. i found the characters memorable. some incidents were slightly hard to believe but all in all a good read
4,Green Tea extract is a great thing to add to your diet regardless of what you're doing. These pills are cheap and give you nutrients that your body may need. I would recommend taking this product if you have the extra money to spare and want to get the benefits from green tea without actually drinking anything.
4,"I use these on a daily bases. My parents usually go to bed before I do, therefor the 55in LED TV with 7.2 surround sound in the living room is also asleep. Not anymore! I've owned these for a year now and have use them to primarily watch movies and play video games in the latter hours of the night without disturbing my family. They are crisp and clear with a fidelity like no other wireless headphones on the market. Now they aren't perfect. They lack some low end and can also become uncomfortable if not seated on your head correctly. Other than that they are great! I highly recommend this product!"
4,"Although this is one of Prescott's older books, I finally read it and I'm not disappointed. Lots of action, suspense and good character development.Abby is a strong character with her own set of rules, almost manic in the novel. Talking incessantly, sarcastic and full of sharp wit. You can clearly visualize her behavior as she works to uncover the truth. Tess, the ever conservative tightass Fed, trying to color in between the lines but constantly drawn out by Abby. The congressman, his aide and the other players round-out an excellent cast with a good conclusion and the set-up for more to come.I've read Prescott's newer novels, which is why I went back to read this one. ""Stealing Faces"" is still my 5-star favorite, but this one is a 4-star to me. Definitely worth reading."
4,"William W Johnstome was suffering from cancer then dies in the early part of 2004. It is believed a ghostwriter did all or part of the last few books due to Johnstone's illness.Sure, it would be nice if the last few books had been written the way Johnstone would have but at least those final books gave us an ending of the Raines saga. Better than being left dangling.I rated the book a 4 because the book helped to show the end of the Raines story."
4,The content of this book is excellant but the binding came unglued when i first started reading the book.
4,"This is a dark,scary movie starring the late actress Brittany Murphy as Alice in ""Deadline"". Alice is a struggling author who is recovering from psychological breakdown, needs inspiration to finish her screenplay in time against a fast approaching ""Deadline""! She stays in a spooky victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere, but things start to happen : strange noises, creaky doors, moving furniture & other paranormal things which make her mind to run wild! This is a slowly evolving scary movie that also features Thora Birch & Sean McConville, will thrill ""ghost/spooky"" story loving fans.The story has a good plot, but the story rather develops slowly & intruiging at the same time."
4,"This is a great pair of shoes. I've owned several adidas shoes now with the A3 cushioning. All of them are great, and this is no exception. My only complaint is the color. I wished the yellow was not so bright, although I did expect that when I made the purchase. However, I intend on using these for night time running only. The only reason I give this a 4 out of 5 star is due ot the fact that I think the shoe is too bright to wear everywhere (without getting odd stares)."
4,"The combination of adventure, intrigue and love delivers a very potent message. Once past the first few chapters the book simply cannot be put down as it challenges your mind to anticipate the fast developing events ending with a stunning and unpredictable finish."
4,"Fun and engaging! The plot is unique and fun, it is rare to see a truely fresh movie that the kid will enjoy!"
4,"I wish I would have waited till the DVD came out because I paid $29,99 for the VHS tape. But anyway, very good movie and Connery is at his best after the post 007 era. He is more of a classy verison of Dirty Harry where he breaks all of the rules to get the terrorist but does it with charm!"
4,I really enjoyed this Victoria Holt book.She weaves mystery very well. I Like that her books are clean but still interesting.
4,"So far this seems to be working well. My dogs eat it with their food. I cannot determine how much it helps the coat, but it is overall beneficial."
4,"This game turned out to be a good game. The way the boat moves and gameplay is the greatest. The storyline gets a bit confusing with the wierd names they use for the characters. You have to beat certain levels on certain difficulties to get nice new boats and arenas to use in multiplayer.Some of the levels seem impossible, though. There are no checkpoints to save your progress in the middle of a level. If you like and never get sick of blowing up other boats with many weapons, this is the best game for you."
4,"I have to admit I was surprised at the reviews this book got, because I've never had a problem with it. But since I have used it less than 5 times, I guess I just got lucky and picked the 5 good recipes in it! I guess I'll have to keep using it to see if it was really worth it..."
4,"I couldn't put it down and naturally, I loved the tie in with restoring paintings, because I am a painter.I devoured this book!"
4,"If you've failed to notice, Dark Tranquillity has a habit of releasing a new album around the same time as In Flames. ""Damage Done"" continues the tradition, being the counterpart to ""Reroute to Remain."" ""Damage"" is by far the better album. The melodies aren't as insipid, bland and marshmallow-y sounding. The lyrics make much more sense than ""Reroute""'s generic stereotypical pop-nu-metal kludge. The songs are not as incredibly formulaic and stiff, and it's just plain HEAVIER and more driving.However, ""Damage"" is a small regression for DT. While not as mechanical as the structure of ""Reroute""'s songs, ""Damage""'s songwriting is more ""traditional"" and formulaic than the dazzling, unpredictable tempo and melody changes on ""Mind's I"". Gone are all singing, acoustics, and ""mellowness"" in general, creating an album that for me just sounds a little stripped.This is still a great album, the album ""Reroute to Remain"" was meant to be, if you will."
4,This album was so slick and unlike Culture Club's previous releases - yet it was extremely good. I guess the drugs got in the way and I feel like there could have been so much more to come after this one. Culture Club produced many great albums in a very short span of time. You kind of get that though it sounds so good - the heart wasn't in it - and then they broke up.
4,"With an album as scattered as glee coming from apparently more of an unformed collective than a solid group I was expecting a big sophomore slump in discosis. I was too curious to resist the purchase and the album has been playing constantly since. The Curtis Mayfield track is a fantastic song and I wish had been more of a hit, the sexy crooning that is not afraid to be fancy is such a nice change of pace from all the soundalike gutteral voice rock bands howling around. Also it sets a nice tone that the rest of the album holds up except for one or two tracks (I am thinking ""The answer"" and ""loaded"" specifically) Overall this album is not a simple rehash of glee material, there are certainly more real songs here, and some stunning moments in ""More Shopping"" & ""montreal"" which ends in a chant that loops back again later in the album. Very impressive -"
4,"If you're considering a purebred dog, make sure you check out these books by Dr. Bruce Fogle. They're full of up to date info and colour photos. The profile on the Labrador Retriever features information on general care, feeding, training, grooming, and exercise."
4,"I found this book on a lending library's shelf, and I was so pleased that I picked it up. Based on the author's blog, the story walks you through 365 days experimenting with French cooking. I quite enjoyed reading about Julie's efforts to follow the recipes, some of them quite arcane, and turn out interesting meals. There are moments when the book gets bogged down in some of the blog chat and could possibly have used some more editing, but overall it was an enjoyable and fun read. Now that I'm almost finished with My Life in France about Julia Child, I may give this book a re-read. I think both will be good prep for the movie, which I also eagerly await. Bon appetit!!"
4,"I had good luck with these diapers, but found the Swaddlers fit better. These Baby Dry don't have the stretchy tabs, so they are harder to get a good fit. I know the size 3 has the stretchy tabs, but I guess the smaller sizes don't. These diapers never leaked! I always have great luck with Pampers products. Would definitely recommend."
4,Little different than what I expected but it was good The main actors stick to the story and there are a couple twists to keep you interested.
4,"After trying many 'get organized' books without much success (but acquiring a nifty assortment of filing bins/ folders/ labels/ dust-collectors in the process), and having my (very orderly-minded) mother despair of persuading me to use budget books or create tidy files, I finally found a book that addresses all the ways I'm disorganized in my life. The chapter on how an ADD-challenged person's financial systems can fall apart if any other part of their life spins out of control really hit home, and I'm going to spend January working out ways to implement the authors' suggestions. The only other volume that helped me, especially re: my business life, was ""Organizing for the Creative Person: Right-Brain Styles for Conquering Clutter, Mastering Time, and Reaching Your Goals,"" by Dorothy Lehmkuhl and Dolores Cotter Lamping. I'd recommend them both."
4,"This is my second general use digital camera, replacing a five year old Olympus which just became too slow between pictures, a software problem which I could not solve.HP has developed an excellent camera in that all the options are available in the software of the camera itself. No more carrying the instructions book and frantically trying to find how to perform some functions. Now one can frantically go throgh all the steps on the screen until the function is found.So far I am satisfied with the camera, I have not used it long enough to run out of battery and I bought a spare to keep with me at all times when that does happen. The memory in the camera is inadequate except for an emergency, but a 2 Gig card has taken care of that.I have not gotten used to using to screen for shooting pictures as yet, I hope that by the end of vacation this month I have mastered the techniques for doing that. Too many years of shooting through a lens finder."
4,"Don't get me wrong. I love my Garmin 305 Forerunner, but I bought it instead of the 205 for the HRM. It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOO tiny that it's almost impossible to see, even standing still, let alone running."
4,"Carly Simon is one of those artists I wait for. This one does not disappoint. I'm sure there will be some who would prefer a louder album, but this one is great because it mixes really old songs with covers for our contemporaries with a few surprises also in store. I especially enjoyed her duets with her son Ben."
4,An excellent piece of history with captivating stories from those who can tell them best....the heroes of that time.
4,"Although it took me a little while to gain interest in the characters, the book crept up on me and ended up being a good read. The story has it's romance, but the tragedy around the lives of the main characters is what really wraps you in. There were a couple of moments where I felt I was missing something in translation, but it didn't change the main elements of the story."
4,"It is a good book for you to read if you are into fantasies. The whole book is quite interesting, but there are some ancient words you'll have to know"
4,excellent device...works accutately every time I use. The mount secures the device between the shoe laces and you don't even know you are wearing it. Great accessory to the Polar RS800 watch.
4,I think this game is a lot of fun when with friends. It's pretty boring if your solo. The bad thing is this barely has any characters and since the N64 controller is pretty simple so there aren't many moves. The good thing is there is a lot of explosives which I tend to like.
4,"This DVD is worth every penny I paid for it. Really, I'd pay twice that amount, considering how much enjoyment my children have gotten out of it. They watch it over and over, until I make them turn it off anyway. They giggle hysterically the whole time, and then walk around for the next few days acting out their favorite parts (thankfully not in a way anyone gets hurt) and quoting others. They've picked up on the ""say oui, not si"" joke and run with it. (7 year old asks 4 year old ""did you see that part in Star Wars where..."". 4 year old answers, ""say oui, not si"". Both fall over laughing.)I suppose it might annoy someone else, but I grew up watching ""The Inspector"", and it was one of favorite cartoons. It's not quite as hilarious to me now, or I would have given it 5 stars. But it's still a great show, that your kids will love."
4,"Mid-tempo on the verge of laid-back psych freakbeat mightily reminiscent of the early Bee Gees in their ""Massachusetts"" mode. I like Kaleidoscope a lot and thought the arrangements and peformances were very original. The title tune and ""Snapdragon"" are the tracks to watch. Packaged in a cardboard EZpak case with a very nicely designed booklet."
4,"I enjoy the music on this CD. It is funny and has a great funk beat. Mr George Clinton made his mark by building on the Funk of Mr James Brown. Many of the JB team became members of Parliment. Here, Mr Clinton updates those rhythms of the seventies by adapting them to the sound of the eighties. He has lots of great help from his friends, including Bootsie Collins, and a singer-songwriter who used to have a name. ;D Not only is the Funk the best, the songs are entertaining, tongue-in-cheek social statements. ""Quickie"" exposes the little known secret that ladies sometimes make a Bootie Call. ""Last Dance"" is a good-natured parody of ""Let's Dance"" by Mr David Bowie, and the title track is an anti-nuke commentary. If you enjoy humour in your music coupled with Super Super Heavy Funk, this CD will be interesting to you."
4,"This is the first in the Women's Murder Club series and it is the first James Patterson book I've read. He is a popular and prolific writer, and this thriller doesn't disappoint. It may not be great literature, but it is easy reading with very short chapters and it keeps the reader's interest to the end. The reason I read the book is because of the TV series based on these books about four women -- a detective, a medical examiner, a crime reporter and an assistant district attorney -- who band together to solve crimes. They call themselves the Women's Murder Club. In this first book Detective Lindsay Boxer is also battling a serious illness and is involved in a romance as well as solving a series of murders. This is a good book to take along on a trip. It will help pass the time at the airport and on the plane."
4,I have been using this GPS unit for a year now. It is really a very good tool. Since I'm in Europe I couldn't use the added software so I bought GPSPilot and Route. I use a PC base routeplanner (Route 66 Benelux) and download the maps into the Palm. Takes me about 10 minutes extra from the normal planning process.The GPS unit keeps me on course all the time. Very impressive.
4,"Yet another excellent book in the Lucas Davenport ""Prey"" series. This book finds Lucas in St. Louis, on the trail of an old nemesis, Clara Rinker. Ex-hitwoman Rinker has been forced out of hiding, and Davenport is called in to assist the FBI in trying to stop her latest killing spree. As usual, this is another quick read, filled with interesting plot twists, and some new interesting characters. One of my few complaints is that Sandford does some heavy foreshadowing of one particular plot twist in the book, so that when it comes, it is no surprise at all.This book is 354 pages long."
4,"When I take a class, I don't have a choice in what book the instructor chooses. If the book is readable, illustrates concepts clearly and helps me study (via useful reference lists, intelligent problems and helpful study guides), then I'm happy. If it does that concisely, like this book did, then I'm stoked. Is this book AMAZING? No. There could have been more and more challenging problems, better pacing, and more or less coverage in several sections. But since any book should be supplemented by a professor's problems and lectures, that should not be necessary. I got everything I needed from the class in which I used Lay's Linear Algebra, and the book carried its weight. I now use it as a handy reference. Very good course book choice."
4,"We took the chairs down to Cancun. Could have sold a bunch of them to people at the pool. Everyone loved them. Very stable in the water, especially when you are visiting the swim-up bar. These chairs are especially nice because they have cup-holders in the arm-rest. You just sit back and float or get pushed around by your cabana boy(spouse)."
4,I used to have I think a 900mhz version that fuzzed out when ever...there were numerous interferances. This one works quite well given the same interferences. I am very happy with it.
4,"Heaven's Reach is an enjoyable conclusion to the Uplift Stormseries, but the author tried to pack too much into this last volume,and the story was hard to follow. (Maybe I read it too fast, but Ifelt like I was in ""E space"" for the last third of the book...)Minor complaints aside, I couldn't put Heaven's Reach (or any of the others) down. If you made it through Sundiver, don't worry, you'll like it."
4,"I have long admired Ms. Weir's non-fiction, and was quite interested to explore her first novel. I found it to have the same elegant prose and consistent pacing as her earlier books, though I found it to be lacking in the rich detail and development that exemplify Ms. Weir's works.I enjoyed Ms. Weir's depictions of the relationships between Lady Jane Grey and her Tudor cousins (as most novelists falsely assume them to have been unpleasant). However, I found the characterization of Jane to be somewhat uneven and the beginning of the novel to have highly unrealistic depictions of the cognizance of young child, even a precocious one. The constantly revolving point of view displayed a weakness in the narrative, and detracted slightly from the continuity.I look forward to reading Ms. Weir's next work, either fiction or non-fiction."
4,"Good product, the sound is clear and the functionality is incredible and no problems interacting with other peopleThe only problem I had is that sometimes it does not connect to my desired controllerBut despite that its a very good communicator"
4,"I admit that this album isn't as good as the others before this one, but you have to give this album some credit. Yeah he doesn't have Timbaland but he's done a good job on his own. There are plenty of beautiful songs on this cd like, ""Chedda Brings"", ""In Those Jeans"", ""Locked Down"", ""Stingy"", ""Love You More"", etc. I must also admit that no album has topped ""The Bachelor"", but he's doing his best. I'll always be a Ginuwine supporter because his albums always have at least four songs I like unlike some albums but I'm not gonna say who.*sneeze*-Monica's new album. Oops it slipped."
4,"Good plot, leads automatically into sequel. Author did a good job creating believable characters. Interesting story development. Will read more of this aurhor."
4,"A little pricey, but great quality, durable and does the job. She likes it.....that's all that matters, right!? Overall, not bad."
4,"I loved this story. I won't go into much detail, because there are so many other reviews.The only reason I gave it four stars (instead of five) was because of the low quality of the Kindle eBook.The proofreading was HORRIBLE. Words were missing; punctuation was missing; words wereruntogether (get it?); some word swere split and joined to the next word (get it?).I really love reading the eBooks on the Kindle, but this is a good example of a book where the quality control was severely lacking."
4,"This third album by the band Lit follows similar lines of their second album A Place in the Sun. The guitar on some of the songs resembles the more hardcore musical stylings of Tripping the Light Fantastic, but keeps that So. Cal. feeling. While some of the songs sound more like pop, there is still a feeling of the boys from Orange County. Atomic is a good album and is a great addition the any fan of Lit."
4,"What I love about Imperial Teen is their ornery playfulness. Where on their debut they were in-your-face provocateurs, with On this intergender group are giddy seducers barely containing their enthusiasm. These 12 tracks pass at a clip with goofy handclaps and sing-along choruses abounding (though fat chance any of them will get on the radio). They seem slight at first, fizzy like the lightest champagne, but with a kick. ""Baby"" might be a love song to a dog or God. ""Sugar"" invokes the secret thrill of interracial love. ""My Spy"" flirts with bisexuality. ""Our Time"" celebrates the sexual liberation manifest not only in San Francisco, where Imperial Teen live and play, but in the cities and suburbs where the band reaches their small yet passionate audience of fellow hedonists."
4,Just what I was looking for. I particularly liked the the design snippets at the back and there were plenty of them.
4,"Great book, religious aspect questionable, inventive space ships, good character building. Only bad part i cannot purchase 2nd and 3rd part on my Kindle, somehow not available for Europe, sad!"
4,This is a quick read that will provide a good laugh at the expense of mass market con artists.I'm not sure which is funnier : this book - or those reviewers below who feel cheated because they took the title seriously.
4,"I have white spots on my face (no pigmentation), so I bought this product on my dermatologist's recommendation and was pleasantly surprised as to what a difference it has made on my appearance. My face looks a lot more normal and the white spots are not as obvious. Very easy to use this product and it blends well with your skin. Just make sure you rub it and spread it evenly. Better than the other brands I've tried."
4,Its great blade and handle makes for fast peeling jobs. Only thing would be: I wish the peels didn't hang on to the end once peeled off.
4,"I read this book in a day.Very enjoyable reading. Really well-written and contains fascinating info. I learned a lot.I like the way he takes the long view and puts the Technological Revolution into a historical context. He is an insider without being a tech-head, and he makes that whole world VERY accessible for the rest of us who aren't in the industry.He doesn't get carried away with the power and fast money of this world, and I enjoyed his clear-eyed analysis.He writes with affection and honesty about the people he comes across. For this reason, I think Bronson is best suited to write non-fiction, although I did enjoy The First Twenty Million Is Always the Hardest.He humanizes the Digital Revolution and without resorting to hype lets the passion, excitiment, and phenomenal risk associated with Sillicon Valley come through loud and clear.At the end of this book, it was all I could do not to pack my bags for California. Seriously."
4,"The Buddha From Brooklyn is captivating account about the cult of personality surrounding Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo, the spiritual leader of the largest Buddhist monastery in the United States.A quick read, the book is by all accounts a balanced and unbiased expose of the cult-like devotion and absolute corruption within this seemingly peaceful environment. Jetsunma's greed and hypocrisy makes Jim Baker look positively christ-like.Share this with your friends and family."
4,"I truly love to cook and was successful cooking recipes in the Joy of Cooking at age 10. I'm constantly searching for good ideas -- in magazines, books, and on TV. I've been working on ""evolving"" my approach to be more healthful, and found Kitchen In the Clouds to be a true inspiration! In addition to the easy and delicious recipes are wonderful words to raise your consciousness. Perhaps not for the jaded vegitarian, this book is definately nourishing for those cooks who know the most essential ingredient in every dish is love!"
4,"I picked this one up when it first came out in paperback. After Cell, I was ready for another crazy ride. Unlike Cell however, I found it very hard to get into this one when I first started it in April. I put it down and moved on to other things. I came back to Lisey's Story in the days before the release of Duma Key, and it was like reading a different book from the first attempt. I thought this was a really great story and enjoyable read."
4,"This fictional account is of a girl who becomes co-pharaoh of Egypt with her brother during the First Dynasty. It is lyrically and almost magically written, giving a sense how ancient Egyptians might have thought about themselves, their life and their religion. It is, however, hard to know and separate what are solely the imaginings of the author from what is based on known facts about ancient Egypt at that time."
4,"I loved some of the song's on this album like colors of thewind by christy charlson ramono she is a brutiful singer andalso a really good roll model.i wont say im in love bythe cheetah girls i loved that song it was very cool.under thesea by raven, i hated the jamaican remix that didnt sound right."
4,My husband lost one of his boards so we ordered another. He is very pleased with the product. The shipping was quick and he was able to go fishing and caught some nice size walleyes.
4,"It's fast, convenient, and fairly accurate. It gives a reading in under 10 seconds. I would have given it 5 stars but it isn't 100% accurate. I took different readings only seconds apart it and it gave me three different temperatures, although they were only .2 degrees away. A mercury thermometer always gives the same reading if taken at the same time.Fast - grade AConvenience - grade AAccuracey - grade B"
4,"""Samba Blim"" was the follow up to A&Ms release of ""We and the Sea"" and it is really nice to see it out on CD.This is a more accesable and generally lighter set than its predecessor but that should not be considered a criticism. This is about as nice as Bossa Nova gets. Beautiful music with substance and a lot of heart.The reason I only gave this four stars is because my experience with ""Samba Blim"" is limited to the LP. One of the LPs virtues was the tasteful recording job done by Rudy Van Gelder. Occasionally high end re-mastering can result in overly bright CDs.Even so, the worse that could happen is that you will have to thottle back the treble a little bit. Highly recommended."
4,"I love these dishes so much that I purchased service for 8 for our home in FL.It came very quickly but a dessert bowl was damaged, but Amazon made good on it, thats why I continue to shop here.The Pistoulet colors go with every thing and I love the designs that blend with each different pattern in the collection."
4,We were fortunate to hear Alexi Murdoch in San Francisco as a guest of Van Morrison. His voice has a timeless quality with the sound to cross many genres. We look forward to sharing his music for many years to come. The music on this CD is for anyone from 4 to 94. This CD has touched a chord that brought back many thoughts and memories and promised something new.
4,"S Emotionally, it's suspenseful and all too realistic; I wonder how many of the young men who fight overseas are vulnerable to the teachings of radical anything? Remembering the recordings of Tokyo Rose of WWII attempting to brainwash/seduce the boys to betray their homeland. Terrorism is so scary to contemplate and this series explores my worst fears."
4,"Took a flier on SpecialTeas.com and i am very happy. Came within one week packaged in mylar resealable packages. My previous experience with this has been at high end tea outlets. Fragrant, excellent tasting. This surpassses my previous experiences. I suppose I gave it only 4 stars because I want to leave room for a Nirvana tea experience (but this one was excellent)."
4,"Good nice headset fro those of you who want one, but don't want to drop 50 bucks for one. It feels good and probably is better than the one Microsoft offers."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I recently visited the location of this book's setting so it made it all more interesting and more personal to me to read.
4,"it definitely does have better than average suction. it definitely does pick up what another vacuum, even a good one, leaves behind. it does a particularly amazing job on carpets. i am amazed and a little disgusted at what it gets out of my carpets.the pull out rod is a bit unwieldy. it is supposed to extend 17 feet, but it doesn't like extending at all. you pull it out and take two steps and the vacuum comes zipping into your toes. but you get used to it. only real complaint would be that the bottom is too big to get under anything, not the sofa, not the bed, not the space under the counter. that makes the rod necessary more than i'd like."
4,"For all the people that know and love Koontz this book is a must read. I have every last book written by Koontz, with the exception of his new one(already in the mail!) And enjoy everyone of them. This book is very well written and has plenty of plots twist to keep you interested. It also plays on a common fear of not having control over your own life. I honestly stayed awake until 4 in the morning reading this book because I honestly could not put it down. I hope you buy this book and enjoy it as much as I did!"
4,"This volume has some solid works on it, and overall is a worthy edition to the MST3K collection. Each of the four movies featured have their strong and weak points, and everybody will have their favorites, but this is how I ultimately rated each one in terms of performances by the stars of the show:Boggy Creek II: 8/10Merlin: 7/10Time Chasers: 8/10The Touch of Satan: 9/10Each episode made me laugh out loud, which says a lot in itself since few shows do. Pick this up if you're looking for a new type of comedy or are a fan of MST3K."
4,"I am a video game junkie, but I have never been a fan of fighting games. Street Fighter was ok. But, I will have to admit that MK4 won me over.Employing the practice mode into the game was a very smart decision. It makes one wonder why it was never done before. I am not an expert at this game, but I would recommend to use Lui Kang.I enjoyed this game so much that I am interested in buying a copy."
4,This book is exactly what it says it is. It is a book of instructions on using the Logan Mat Cutter. I have an awesome Logan cutter and love it!!!! This book shows me how to cut fancy mats I haven't been able to do before. It is a welcome addition to my bookshelf.
4,"ES CITRICO, EN ALGUNAS CHICAS QUEDA MUY BIEN, EN OTRAS NO MUCHO, DEPENDE DE LA QUIMICA, PERO ES BUENO SI TE QUEDA"
4,I liked it so much a bought a second one for our seasonal home. It is so simple to use and clean. Just great
4,"This book is the best intro to the subject that I've seen. The authors minimize the use of notation, mathematics and the like, and invoke the reader's intuition by developing some good, concrete examples. They present those examples as datasets (accessible on the web), as ""run"" regressions (i.e. with parameter estimates and standard errors), and graphically.They also demo how to ""run"" each of the examples on a PC, using the program MLn. If you don't use MLn (and I had never heard of it); this part of the book is less helpful. It would be great if, in an accompanying website perhaps, they were to demo the same analyses using other packages (e.g. SYSTAT, SAS and the like). But this book is really quite good, and a terrific addition to any applied social scientist's library."
4,"This is a great rack, similar to those that cost three of four times more than this one does. The whole rack is heavy duty but still looks good.As suggested by others, I spray painted the chain black but this is purely a cosmetic change."
4,"True no documentation and not a lot of George Benson, but the piano player and the rhythm section are top-notch. Obviously stars in the field who an astute jazz fan might identify. This is a great set. I think the sound quality is pretty good."
4,"Mrs. Hen yearns for a baby chick to love. To her delight, one day she discovers an egg in her garden and realizes now she can have a chick of her very own. She takes the egg home and sits on it as any good hen would and dreams of her little chick-to-be. Mrs. Hen's friends think she's crazy -- the egg is enormous and polka-dotted and they don't think it will ever hatch. For a long time, it doesn't. After a year or so of sitting on the egg, Mrs. Hen gets frustrated and jostles it, rolls it around, and hits it with a broom in an effort to get it to hatch, but with no luck. She decides to roll it back down the hill, where it cracks at the bottom and out comes her chick -- which turns out to be a dinosaur. She doesn't care that it looks funny for a chick -- she loves it anyway. The illustrations of Mrs. Hen, particularly of her excitement on finding the egg, are charming and full of life."
4,"This one takes a few listens to really catch on (just like most of their albums). And just like most of their albums you will have your favorite songs and songs that you'll continuously skip. You've heard these songs before, but now they are being played by Puffy. That is the only difference. I personally loved their album ""Nice"" the most because of the production value. Most of their others have been pretty raw like this one. But if you love Puffy and you can't get enough... this should take care of you for a while."
4,"When I bought this cd I knew that the WWMT was a dance group but I didn't know what the music sounded like and so I just bought it. Now I think It is a really cool dance cd that just makes you wanna... Dance! The First Song, Frantik, is sorta Jazzy but still good to dance to. The Franik and Truth Remixs are really good to dance to too. I like # 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,11 and 12. They are really good songs and they have good lyrics that talk about the lord. I like most of the album but some songs aren't that much good to dance to, but give it a try and buy this cd!"
4,"This is a lovely machine in most respects. I've owned laptops since 1985 and am not easily impressed, but the MacBook Pro elicited my admiration, at least until I tried to connect to my wireless DSL. The internal AirPort card recognized my 2WIRE DSL modem/router, but when I entered my security code, it wouldn't connect. Never had a problem with my Fujitsu Lifebook P2120. I even got a six year old ThinkPad running Windows 98 and a Linksys PCMCIA card to connect. After extensive research, I discovered from online forums that Apple's last software update to the AirPort card makes it impossible to connect with many wireless routers, not just 2WIRE's.I purchased an Airport Express and connected it to my 2WIRE through their ethernet ports and the MacBook now connects wirelessly to the Airport Express without problems. Apple should aprise people about to buy a Mac about this problem."
4,"I'm not much of a cookie eater, but this snack was recommended in the book BELLY FAT CURE by Jorge Cruise as part of a healthy eating plan. I purchased several flavors. Although at first I felt they tasted a bit ""low-sugar-y,"" I soon got to like them a lot. Possibly this happened because the eating plan in the book restricts sugary foods, and I soon became accustomed to less sugar.My husband is a diabetic and he loves these too. They certainly can fit into a low-sugar diet as a satisfying snack. I would recommend you give these a try."
4,"As I said in an earlier review I returned my first 55-200 VR lens as defective and received another. It works a lot better. The first one only produced sharp results on the right edge of the frame. The replacement zooms more smoothly, and has typical better center than edge sharpness especially at 200mm. The 55-100mm sharpness is very, very good and although the 200mm is a little soft wide open, it gets much better a stop or two down.Recommended... if you get a correctly assembled lens. Well worth the money."
4,"I am pleased with the push mower I ordered through Amazon. As usual, the product arrived quickly and was very affordable. It is exactly what was expected - a very basic tool for small areas - quick and easy to use and maintain and a good investment for the purpose intended. As to mowing large lawns and such, this may not be a good choice for everyone, but for my purposes, it is perfect! And, this mower never breaks down, easy to store with no gas odors and such, it is quiet and doesn't need fuel other than elbow grease!"
4,"This album was released in 1972. It was initially censored due to it's title ""C*ck On!"" and issued as ""... On!"" The CD was reissued with the original cover art (on the inside). It depicts the group posing naked but for sunglasses and a 'tuck in'. The Song 'C*ck On' was later recorded by Goddo, Greg Godovitz having been the bass player for Fludd. Anyway, about the music... The group is Canadian but the singers Ed and Brian Pilling were originally from England. The Canadian members affected that sound so they sound like an English pop band of the era. The songs are 'AM Gold' sounding and very listenable. The messages tend to be simple and trivial, but the music is entertaining nonetheless. You feel good listening to this album because it is old pop music with generally happy themes. The song ""Cousin Mary"" was perhaps their greatest hit single is still played on the radio today, a testament to the timelessness of this classic album."
4,"This is my first attempt to listen to this album from start to finish with headphones. I'm currently on track 8. If the reader says ""So what's the big deal?"" then they haven't listened to this album. Few survive a Guitar Wolf concert without earplugs and some can't even listen to their records without them. All songs are great and horrible at the same time. The shrill feedback may make one cringe but the chugging fuzz hooks produce incredible gastric effects deep inside one's intestines. Uhhhhhhhh. My personal favs are Missile Me and Link Wray Man.Now I'm on track 11, but I got to turn this off. My ears feel like a piece of pig skin that has been gnawed on by a dog for the last 20 minutes. Time for some Bach."
4,"Makes me wish I stayed awake in Math class. Some of the text is made up of formulas that make my head spin. However I am enjoying reading the stories of the men and their reasoning behind the explinations of how the world works at the atomic level versus the ""real world "" physics of Newton and others. Definitely a time when what we knew to be true was vastly different from what was actually true."
4,I bought these to replace my husbands worn out boat shoes. He loves them. It is hard to find shoes in his size...
4,"I love fairy-tales! The story of Little-Red-Riding hood is a very interesting one. Lon Po Po is a Chinese version with beautiful illustrations, which is the main reason I bought it. I am an aspiring children's book writer and illustrator expanding my collection and knowledge through buying books from amazon. I am a little disappointed by how short the story is, making the book rather thin. I wish I would have found the hard cover version. I would suggest this book to fairy-tale connoisseurs, art enthusiasts, and parents alike. I would recommend getting the hard cover version if possible, especially for children."
4,"The illustrations in this 2003 Caldecott Medal winner are for the most part, an excellent example of picture book illustration. The eye-catching artwork builds suspense, provides humor and expression, and is instrumental in telling this simple, well constructed story. However, I think that two of the full page spreads create confusion. A single rabbit appears to be four different rabbits in a full page spread attempting to show the rabbit carrying a succession of animals to help retrieve a toy plane. In the same manner, the second to last spread attempts to illustrate the rabbit and mouse flying in the plane. Four planes are shown connected by a dotted line. As a professional librarian and children's book reviewer, I found this layout confusing, as did my colleague and our story hour children. Despite these flaws, this is a good picture book, but not a medal winner in my opinion."
4,"Before I comment on the quality, you should know: THIS IS A BIG CENTER SPEAKER! About the size of a smaller wastebasket. If you're space-conscious, you should probably try the smaller model BIC...The center channel is where a majority of the action happens when watching a movie or listening to music in 5.1 mode. If you were to make one upgrade in your setup, you get the most bang for the buck with the center.Anyhow, big speaker, big sound. The sound is wide enough to create a convincing 'wall of sound' with the left and right fronts. With the separate woofers and tweeters, instruments are well-separated in the mix and also provide a pretty-sounding bass.If you are an appreciator of audio and have a capable system, I would highly reccomend this as a purchase. I come from an 'all-in-one-home-theater' background, so hearing something with this much clarity and richness was new and quite noticeable."
4,"This is my second mini processor. I still have my first one-about 5 years. My husband shapened the blade as it had become dull. Would be lost without it. Use it for chopping onions and garlic mostly. Another use is to make fresh bread crumbs, and I like it to grind up Romano or Parmesan cheese. Came in handy to puree baby food this week-end."
4,"If you have no clue what the LSAT is all about and need an introduction, this is the book for you. It helps to alleviate whatever fear or trepidation one may have of the exam. It makes it so that you know the LSAT is doable.Additionally, the CD that accompanies the book provides additional insights and other information relating to law school application.However, if you have had little practice or at least know what to expect in the exam, then this book is definitely NOT for you. This, because the book teaches at very rudimentary level, employing questions that are simplistic and are therefore not real LSAT questions.If your goal is preparation weeks before the exam, then you are better of studying 'The Official LSAT SuperPrep and practicing on past LSAT exam questions.It is a well thought out and organized book, nonetheless."
4,"The music itself has come a long way, they are definetly sampling to prove that they are not ""boy band."" Trying two step, some techno...they've come a long way from their debut. The lyrics are just as catchy as ever, sometime a little lame ""if i couldn't have cheese like every day..."" all in all this one's a keeper!"
4,"I find this bra very supportive and comfortable, specially the straps and the sides of the bra that ""hugg"" your breasts and there is no overhang. The color is beautiful and practical (warm taup) which I can wear under any color clothing being that it won't show through, giving a smooth outer effect."
4,"Even though this movie is pretty bad, if your a ""true"" Village People fan it really won't matter. Fans whose love comes from the heart, like mine, are able to laugh at the bad stuff and really bust a gut at the ""really bad stuff."" The milkshake scene is something to laugh at!I was a shame that this movie didn't get more attention when it first came out. The VP were an icon for disco and they are still going stronger then ever today. I have never known of another group to beable to draw a crowd like they do and perform like it was the first time.I enjoyed every minute of this movie, remembering when I saw it for the first time all those years ago. It actually opened on my birthday and I used to think that they did it for me because I was their #1 fan and I still am at 32 years old. THE VILLAGE PEOLE ARE THE BEST!"
4,"Most of the songs on the cd are amazing except for 2 which arent really my type. Some of the songs might start up really good from the beginning when u start hearing the voice and drums kick in, but some of the songs might start up average and as the music goes by it turns really good. so basicaly like in a club u usually hear the best stuff as time goes later.Bottom line is, this is good progressive house but for that price i expected a bit more. But thats just my thing, dont hezitate to buy this!"
4,Clear binding edge - loads easily - acid free Works for my filing system. I like that it's clear and not opaque.
4,"I was apprehensive at first, because the reviews on this product were mixed. I like this remote, It is time consuming to program, but it works well and the on-line download was a big help. Thanks"
4,"The Templar Legacy by Steve Berry is an enjoyable read. The story covers all the same old Templar histories, but the author's added insights especially on the conflicts found in the gospels is refreshing. That truth is not the enemy of faith is once again proved out in this story of modern day Templars struggling between righting ancient wrongs and remaining true to the foundations of their order. The clues and puzzles that drive all the characters and the rights and wrongs of their own personal pasts add intrigue and scope. The story also has a small important part of modern life that most literature totally ignores, that of the divorced man who is living away from his children. What gives this story real worth is that the reader is left to weigh the value of truth, wealth, and knowledge against each other. This is a book of many puzzles some are blatant and others merely nuances."
4,"I bought the silver version of this watch as I have quite a few watches (I'm addicted to watches). So, rather than spend the extra cash on the gold version, I decided to try the stainless steel item.It comes magnificently packaged and is very attractive and worth the money, but it is a misnomer to say it is the world's thinnest watch. I have a watch specially made for Sachs Fifth Avenue, bought in 1984 for a mere pittance that is as thin as the Steinhausen watch. It, also, has a Swiss quartz movement with a date display at three o'clock, plus it has a sweep second hand that I like.The Steinhausen watch has a true thickness of about 6.5mm, which is much less than some of the behemoth's I own, but certainly isn't the world's thinnest. Nonetheless, I am a fan of this watch--the workmanship is far superior to most, and it is truly a beautiful watch."
4,"Nice sturdy power supply. I bought it to hook up a car amp inside my house and i gotta say that i am disappointed because the current has a lot of feedback and creates static hissing sound, which does not happen when hooked up to a battery. I think if i hook it up to a battery with diodes, it will remove the noise though, so i give 4 stars."
4,"This book gives insight into a frightening aspect of American history: the eugenics movement. While most people equate this term with Nazi Germany, it existed in the US in the form of warehousing children based on dubious IQ tests, and subjecting them to involuntary sterilization, lobotomy, and dangerous experiments. The motivation for these practices was the hope that ""substandard"" people would not reproduce, and allow Americans to become ""the master race."" While the author's style is a little disjointed for my taste, the content is chilling mostly because it is factual. Having been to the grounds of the Fernald School several times, I can still feel the anguish those children experienced echoing between the condemned buildings."
4,"Look this was a good movie, im gonna say if youve never seen it before you can even skip the renting stage and just buy it and you'll be very pleased with your purchase....im just posting because im so sick of seeing these people actually use the 1,000 word maximum......i probably speak for most people when i say that when i see these big long reviews i just skip right through em....i mean a simple plot summary and opinion is really all thats necessary...you supposed ""movie -gurus"" need to get a life and stop boring everyone with your insights because most of the time its a bunch of garbage anyway"
4,"The timely shipping and handling was commendable, and email provided for tracking. There was provision for return in case of defect.I bought this bag because I was tired of mesh bags which entangled me and my laundry. When using them, I was reminded of Roman gladiatorial combats using nets.The denim bag is of good quality and performs as expected. Unfortunately, I can't give it a fifth star, because there was one spot along the side where a seam was split. For an item of this price, it didn't seem worthwhile to ship it back and await another, so I just patched it up with duct tape. That sufficed."
4,"In his small, sleepy town Norman is seen as a bit of a freak; a young boy who talks to himself, seems a bit of a nerd, and therefore has no friends and spends a great deal of his time alone. But Norman isn't talking to himself - he's talking to ghosts, specters he's been able to see, especially, since the death of his grandma (who talks to him regularly at home, often keeping Norman company as he watches TV). Even his own parents and self-absorbed teenage sister don't believe him - think him odd - but when his ability to communicate with the dead calls Norman into service against an oncoming supernatural uprising that threatens his entire town, Norman gathers a few rag-tag buddies to vanquish the undead and break a centuries-old curse ... in what is a truly engaging, funny, and surprisingly good animated film complete with a few twists to the plot you do NOT see coming. Even the animation looks cool."
4,excellant book i saved a bundle because this was a used book which was in good condition
4,"The NIV bible for my kindle fire is a nice addition to my kindle, but navigation is a little difficult and not at all intuitive."
4,"you are just the mario characters in a wild world of the most awesome go-kart tracks in the universe!you can get all sorts of power ups that can be used as weopons or traps on the other players.it NEVER gets old,so play on and on and on and ....."
4,"This sleek chrome blender looks as great as it is efficient. It has a nice strong motor, which blends things super fast. Plus, the whole thing disassembles pretty easily so you can wash it out completely. Love it. If you're hesitant to spend the money, do it and buy this one, so you'll never to have to buy one again. Waring is the only brand of blender I'd recommend."
4,"This book takes the beginning verilog student through a quick tutorial with exercises for practice as you learn. The book is well written for learning the subjects it presents. The only reason it does not get five stars is because it is not a good reference. The information is in there, however, the index is incomplete and the information is scattered throughout the book. Finding information takes some manual searching. Otherwise, it is one of the best books for learning verilog. I used the included software instead of the Xilinx Foundation Series software for Students. The included software supports the complete verilog set, not just the sythesizable subset. If you are experienced, looking for a good reference , will spend nearly $150 for a book, and do not need a verilog simulator, I recommend the Complete Verilog Book. See my review of that book for more information."
4,Purchased this book for fun it is very enjoyable I would recomend this book to any one great service A++
4,Item was received very quickly by mail and as described. Had looked locally and was unable to find anywhere.
4,"Another great book from Lori Foster....I was touched by the tenderness of Gab. After getting the impression that he is just a playboy Lori Foster delivers us a Gab with more depth and sensitivity than expected. This was a tender and fun read.As for Jordan, you realize he has more demons to snare than the other brothers so its only fitting he requires a more troubled love interest. I found Jordan interesting and a bad boy with a big heart.Of course, like of of Lori Fosters books emotionally stimulating and lots of hot physical sex. If you liked Once and Again with Sawyer and Morgan you will enjoy Forever and Always with Gab and Jordan."
4,"Got this for me and my bf, he loves the feel of it, though it's a bit short..but that's the point! Only complaint is that it can be a little delicate."
4,Provides the necessary tools and information we need to move forward with our major project for our organization. Worthwhile!
4,"I heard about this product from a friend and am glad I did. It has lived up to my expectations completely. My dog, a female schnauzer, consistently barked at all my neighbors each time I walked her in my condominium community, regardless of the number of times she encountered them. Since purchasing the anti-bark collar, she has learned that it is not acceptable behavior to bark at neighbors or other pets while she is on her leash with the anti-bark collar on. She is able to hold her expression to a low bark."
4,"It's not one of those mattress toppers that you just sink in, but it forms around the body very well and provides great support. Haven't had back pain ever since i got this!"
4,"The moment I played the game I fell in love with it. The music was quirky and refreshing and the gameplay was far from serious. It gave me a real break from other games on the market that have serious/complicated storylines and gamplay.I wouldn't buy this if you only like games that have a strong plot and goal. This game is really about rolling a ball around just to make it bigger, nothing else."
4,"This book being read by the fellow with an accent is the best. He is very capable and reads the Latin, Gaelic, French, etc., very precisely and clearly. I still did not know the words, but at least I could understand what he was saying.This is a history of the Irish, it just so happens that the Irish did preserve a lot of ancient literature which became an important part of our civilization after the Dark Ages. This history begins and ends with the sad review of the Irish in recent years, from 1800 to the present. The interesting part is St. Patrick's conversion of the Irish into Christians and how that became the basis of saving civilization."
4,"common is my favorite rapper, which has been the case for years. i was so excited to get this album... but i was a little disappointed to hear so much kanye on it. i know they are friends and all, but common doesnt need one ounce of kanye to shine. i felt like it was a gimmick to guarantee the album's sales, since kanye is ""so hot"" right now. when it comes to common though, his lyrics always make me stop and think, they grab me when i least expect it. i agree with his lifestyle (veganism...no animal cruelty), and i always admire his progressive way of thought. little less kanye, and way more common and you have a classic album."
4,Macbook fits perfectly in the case. Easy to carry. Good for travelers. I love the color.
4,"Bolton does a good job of teaching communication strategies. He identifies ""high risk"" responses -- words that put up barriers between people and lead to resentment and anger. He also discusses the art of reflective listening, reading body language, and, finally, assertiveness. He correctly states that being assertive will, on occasion, bring you into conflict with others. The book instructs you on how to deftly handle conflict and defensiveness. This is where the tough skills of listening and communicating come into play.Bolton's writing style is steady and clear, but not especially lively. That makes the book somewhat of a chore to read, despite the good information contained therein. I would give it 5 stars for content alone, but 3 stars for presentation. Odd, in fact, that a book on communication fails to maintain an interesting tone."
4,"I received this book promptly, and it came in good condition, but without the (pictured) dust jacket. It's certainly not a deal breaker for me, though I believe if it's in the picture, it should be in the package. Otherwise fast, easy service, and a charming book."
4,"Easy to use. Worth the price. Have used it several times, even on frozen macadamia nuts. Cleans up easily in dishwasher."
4,"Well, I won't waste your time. The bottom line-- is this book is worth buying. Its got great insight on many of Gauguin's paintings, and even discusses his background and influences. A must for any art student, or art buff. Your money will not be wasted! For ten bucks, you'll be buying a book you'll use time and time again. Good luck, and happy book buying!"
4,"There is nothing particularly outstanding about this movie, but I enjoyed it the whole time I was watching it and it was fun. The overall feel is very positive and adventurous. Good job."
4,"December 30, 2011I ordered this lasagna for my new years eve celebration, but I decided to prepare it earlier as sort of a pre new years celebration ... a starter. I was not sure what to expect, because when I opened the box it sort of looks like the frozen lasagna I seen in other venues. Well anway, I tossed it in the microwave on the vegetable setting for about 8 minutes and it was done. The cheese on top was real and stringy, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty esp. the ricotta. In my opinion this lasagna gets four stars for freshness, flavor and cheesiness. Love it!!Daphne Savoy"
4,"I purchased this backpack because of the reflective strip on the back. I decided on the black backpack, but the so called ""reflective strip"" was not reflective at all. I tested the reflective strip by placing the backpack in one of my bedrooms, no lights on, almost completely blacked out, and shined a flashlight on it with the results showing no hint of reflective properties on this backpack at all. Otherwise the backpack seems to be of quality material and has a good amount of compartments available throughout. I am still disappointed at the strip not being reflective because I am going to use it for my rides on my motorcycle. I resorted to having a reflective belt being wrapped around the backpack for easier visibility for other motorists on the road.-In short, good quality material, plenty of spacious compartments, but no reflective strip. This was misleading during my decision to purchase it."
4,"Gilead: A NovelI do not think I have ever read a novel that had me weeping by the end. I have also never written a review about anything before, but this book gets me to my computer. I give this 4 stars only because this starts slowly, like a walk to Kansas. This is a very rich piece of human story, and I am so glad to realize that the Pulitzer team knows how to recognize such gentle genius."
4,"I have had a GPS 12 since about 1996 and used it extensively without any problems. It is a great, solid, reliable unit. I have mountain biked, hiked, drove, geocached and backpacked with it.I heartily recommend it to anyone needing a good basic GPS.My only complaint about it is the battery compartment isn't waterproof. This has never been a problem for me, even in the rain, but it seems it would have been simple to make it so it could handle accidental submersion better.Now I am handing it down as I have recently received a Foretrex 101 for Christmas and love it even more, and it cost even less."
4,"I saw the movie which prompted me to read the book. As always to book was much more detailed. The language was obsene at times, but the author gave a realistic account of his life."
4,It was a powerfull book. Follows the wonderfull strength and mystery that always surounds conan of cimmeria. All the conan books make great stocking stuffers for your book worms...
4,"You couldn't find a bigger Paul fan than myself and my family. That said, we were somewhat disappointed with this CD. But I have had that experience in the past and found that it is just because he once again has enhanced his music so that it is not always the same old Paul. I'm certain that, as with Chaos and Creation, it will soon grow on me and become a favorite. When you are speaking of the greatest composer of music in our time, whom we are fortunate enough to have in our midst, it's probably not wise to pass too quick a judgement. I've found at these times, with Paul, that it's usually just because he had grown past me in his vision and I have yet to have caught up."
4,"This game has cool graphics and funky tricks. In some of the courses, they need more lighting. You can hardly see where you're going. When that happens, you run into walls and get stuck and not even a jump can get you going again. It's an okay game."
4,"My daughter loves this Fridge Words. However, I wanted to post that the letters are NOT interchangeable with the old version Fridge Phonics with the frog on it. The Fridge Words letters are smaller than the older Fridge Phonics letters and neither works with the other. I'm disappointed to learn this because I bought her the Fridge Phonics when she was younger and now that she's the right age for the Fridge Words, they've resized the letters. Looking at the store, it looks like the letters are interchangeable with the new Fridge Phonics with the sun on it."
4,This was a nice gift. Comes complete with the knives but the cheese slicer is great! Bought it as a gift for my sister-in-law.
4,"I dont understand people's tiffs on here with Avril Lavigne. Whats up with this ""TONE DEAF"" stuff?I think she is an amazing artist. And, having a very dynamic musician such as Chantal to be by her side makes the song even better to listen to.The Be Good Tanyas song was really well done, as was Six Pense Non The Richer, and Martina Sorbara. The others were quite good too.The only one I didnt enjoy so much was Lisa Hannigan. Christmas is supposed to be joyful... not depressing."
4,"While I did not appreciate that the entire second half of this book included Farber's ""Curb Painting"" book, provided as an example, I did find a LOT of usable suggestions, links and many of my own questions answered. Yes, I could have tracked all of the information down on the Web through trial and error, eventually, however, this book saved me lots of time and effort by doing that for me. Farber's writing style is not as polished as is my preference, but I stuck with the book for its content. I was not diappointed."
4,Imagine the matrix with more action.There is also a lot more violence. The bullet time feature is a must have in other games. Great graphics . Very realistic sounds . A must have for action gamers.
4,"Getting Started in Financial Consulting by Edward J. Stone is a well written description of what you need to do for a career in Financial Counseling. It is well organized, complete and provides inside information on what it takes to get started, run a business, and be a successful Finanacial Counselor. The review of the various certification programs is quite extensive. This book can be considered the bible in not only in getting started in Financial Counseling, but in making it a career. It is also helpful for present Financial Counselors to use as a benchmark to measure up to Mr. Stone's high standards that are essentially required in this profession. Follow his guidelines and you will be successful over the long term. A must read if you are considering going into Financial Counseling."
4,"Bought this for using at parties to keep dips warm, instead of using large crock pot or having to heat things up all the time. Is great for this. Bought 2 more for gifts! The only thing that would make this item better is if it had a warm setting. Hot/high is very hot very fast."
4,This book provides great information about pregnancy. It is worth the purchase especially for first-time mothers. Only problem is that I received this book so late. Not sure why the delay.
4,"I did not give a 5 Stars because I think is a little expensive, ot the shipping make it. But if fot perfectly and protect the Mixer, wich is the most important."
4,"The premise of the movie is very original. And they never break the premise through the whole movie. The ability not to lie seems to also translate into the inability to hold ones tongue, leading to extremely awkward and funny moments.The cast does a good job in their roles. Only the main character grows but as no one else develops the ability to lie this seems in keeping with the premise.Good movie to watch once."
4,"It works great for the purpose I bought it ... extend signal from a Belkin 54G router.As an experiment, I tried the extender with a 2WIRE router from SBC. It did not work."
4,"This series just gets to be more and more fun. I love Holly Winter and her two beautiful Alaskan Malamutes. This book delves into the world of working dogs, more specifically hearing aid dogs. Dogs are wonderful aids for people with all kinds of disabilities. Ruffly is an adorable little mixed breed that lives with a woman who is hearing impaired, and believe me, he takes his job seriously. And we also have a murder to deal with. A murder that it seems only Holly thinks is a murder. The denouement of the murderer is also fun because we have Holly backed by her trusty Rowdy who do the unmasking. This series is definitely for dog lovers, but even those who aren't as fascinated by dogs as some of us will enjoy this warm and wonderful series."
4,"I bought it two weeks ago, I am using it once per day.My teeth are brighter and whiter, and seem cleaner.But since yesterday, I have felt more sensitive to cold food and water ...I think I'm gonna combine with another toothpaste for sensitive tooth."
4,"This Back Rest has a nice, neutral color and the fabric is nice as well. I particularly like that I can fold it so it doesn't take up much space when not in use. I haven't used the massager so I can't say much about that, but the seat itself provides good upright support. Overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase and would recommend the product."
4,"I purchased this piece to for my company to use for a series of high-level meetings. The cordless presenter worked flawlessly including no issue with plug-n-play. It feels sturdy, survived some tumbles off the podium, and battery life has not been an issue. I highly recommend this piece."
4,"This cd is a throwback to the days when metal ruled! Great vocals, very tasteful guitar leads and solid drums. Put this all together and you have one of the best new metal ablums. The three Mikes put together a very good ablum! Mikes vocals remind me of Geoff Tate only with more balls. This is a great Prog-Metal Disc check it out!"
4,"I can't believe this album has only one review here on Amazon!This CD may have been released back in 1995, but the music in it is truly timeless: A combination of funky and jazzy instrumental downtempo songs featuring acoustic drums, synth strings, vibes, electric pianos, funky rhythm guitars and occasional vocals.The sounds on this CD may not be groundbreaking, but the music sounds far from dated. More than 10 Years later, there are a lot of artists creating the same exact type of music featured on this CD. Good music never goes out of style!If you like downtempo / chillout music, this CD will be a worthy addition to your collection!, not only you won't be dissapointed, you will probably purchase other CDs from Fila Brazillia's catalog."
4,"The first time we tried to work this, we couldn't get anything out. We discovered later that we must have overfilled it, since we had the steel version and there was no obvious fill line. After looking up alternative directions in English, which mentioned a fill line, we measured the water beforehand and put in only a liter. Everything worked perfectly after that. We shall see how the whole apparatus holds up."
4,"it is very difficult to cook more than one burger at a time. A 6"" by 7"" cooking surface is just too small for two burgers. This definitely would have received a 5-star rating if the cooking area had been at least 8"" wide.Clean-up is easy and the fat does drain well. You might want to put a folded paper towel under the drip tray.The 'Champ' performs particularly well in grilling cheese, tomato and ham sandwiches."
4,"So far, the book is pretty good. It points out a few things one may not have known about God and money. Presents money from an accountants standpoint and shows that you can run your personal finances the same way you'd run a business. I do see this book being a useful tool in managing my personal fiances."
4,The Mystikal Danger single is a power packed song. I am starting a DJ business and my clients love it. Its a great song no doubt and I play it every party!
4,"McGhee's Clara is a precociously strong-voiced character, but I didn't find her unbelievably so. Instead, I quickly developed affection for her, and smiled at her quirks, like inventing book reports. The novel centers around the friendship she develops with an old man in her town. McGhee is a skillful writer and has crafted lovely characters, as she did in her previous novel, Rainlight. There are some terribly sad moments, but they are ultimately redeemed in this complex, beautifully written novel."
4,"****These little flags from post-it are quite bright and nicer than the little (1/2 inch) skinny ones for marking places in books and on documents.They are very thin, though, so they are ideally not used as index tabs or anything that would require a sturdier flag. Their thinness is an advantage if you are flagging many places in a book or document set as many can be placed without the book or pile of papers becoming bulky. Post-It makes another flag, which it calls their ""Durable"" flag and is heavier if you are looking for something to use as a tab.With most pens and and even with a pencil, they can be written on, which is nice. And of course, they are transparent. I have found the Post-it brand to be consistent in its quality, as opposed to other manufacturers who sometimes don't make the flag sticky enough. They come in a wide variety of colors! This review is for the single pack of one dispenser of green flags.Recommended.****"
4,Not as good as the first two movies in the series but still very entertaining for kids and adults alike.
4,"Nice product, came in perfect condition and sooner then time promised. Calculator was fairly easy to figure out with booklet that came with it. However a tutorial dvd or you tube is needed to understand more involved problems. Basic graphing and algebra is easy to do with the booklet that came with it."
4,Call of Duty 2 is a fun game. The weapons are not high tech but shows what was used in WWII. I enjoyed the different missions that the game posed. The only draw back is that I have a G4 and the game runs very choppy.
4,"So far I enjoy everything about the camera except how long it takes to refresh if the flash is on. It takes between 3-5 seconds, depending on the strength of the batteries, before you can take another picture. If you want to be able to shoot quick shots, you'll have to do it without using the flash. It takes about 1 second between shots without flash."
4,The screen is perfect and it is completely high definition. It's really almost perfect.. the best I've ever seen. On the down side when you first get it it's a little hard to use.. really complicated. But over all it's great. I would really reccomend it.
4,"Politics have never been funnier! Will Ferrell is great as the ""bad Guy"" in this movie. Not as good as Blades of Glory but it's close."
4,"Finally Filter's new c.d. is out and its not disapointing. Their old c.d., Short Bus, lacked the variety that this c.d. has. And this c.d. still has the heavy metal numbers that those of you who bought Short Bus got it for. My advice, Filters, ""Title of Record"" is a definite must have."
4,"Pastor Troy has put out a solid piece of work with Face-Off. I really wasn't into him too much untill I heard ""This Tha City"", which by the way is one of the best songs you'll ever hear. Usually I don't buy Cd's after listening to just one song but this was an exception, and I wasn't dissapointed. Troy holds it down for the South 100%. Among the better songs on the CD are ""Can You Stand the Game"" and ""Oh Father""."
4,"This is a Great video. It shows some older footage, but if this video doesn't get you standing at attention and marching through your house calling out cadence, than you have not served in the armed forces."
4,"I had one of these years ago and really liked it. I got away from drinking coffee so I stopped using it. My husband is a coffee drinker and I like iced coffee but it never tasted the same. I purchased this one and it makes great coffee just like I remember. The concentrate is particularly nice for iced coffee because you start with a cold product. Not like putting hot coffee over ice cubes. I only give it 4 stars because it seems a little pricey for a bunch of plastic. However, ""Made in the USA"" makes the cost easier to swallow."
4,"The detail for this figure is very good with a nicely detailed face and suit. The only problems I encountered involved the arms: the right arm is a little weak so that you need to be extra careful when attaching the hands or you might snap the joint. The same right arm was also made too loose, so that posing with the sword can only be done using both hands. Limited movement with the left arm also means that the sword is either posed directly in front of Cloud, or is hanging limply at the side. Overall, however, I am pleased with the purchase and quality of the figure."
4,"I am actually trained on InDesign, but when I started my position with a nonprofit org they still use Quark 5. I purchased this book to see if I can somehow convert concepts the other way around. This book did a lovely job of showing how to do the same task in Quark and InDesign. It's lifesaver. The only opportunity for change would be illustrations. There are illustrations provided, but I wish there were more. Besides that it's a great bang for your buck."
4,"I like it AND I don't Like it. What I liked is that it had some unseen footage of what went down at Death Row ( ex: behind the scenes of music videos, concert tours, etc.) and a Pretty good collection of music videos. The XXX music videos were also more than entertaining. What I didn't like was how unorganized the DVD was. Music videos were cut short and a poor scene selection. what also pissed me off was how the in between of a group of druggies dissing Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. It just totally disappointed me and made me regret buying it. Welcome To Death Row is obviously a better DVD than This.I did like the rare Music videos such as "" Lil Ghetto Boy"" from Dre's The Chronic"" and "" It Might Sound Crazy"" From Daz' Album, and Midnight Love from Snoop."
4,"This book took me a long time to read because it was hard for me to get interested at first (hence the 4 stars). However, I found that this is one of those books where if you can get through the first half, it turns into a true gem! Once I got through the first half of the book I could not put it down. I finished it this weekend and am already 300 pages into the second book, which just keeps getting better! I recommend this series. It is very hard to stop reading and to get anything else done."
4,"the speakers work great. i love that the subwoofer isn't over powering. i just bought this one for my brother but i've had mine for about 3 yrs and i have had no problems with them at all. they still have a great sound and work perfectly fine. i hook up my computer, my xbox 360 and mp3 player to them all the time and works perfect."
4,"Awesome, owned for several years and still works !Only thing keeping from a 5 is that the laser pointer seems to only work while the battery is ""fully"" changed.able to control laptop from 30 feet."
4,"I heard this in about 9th Grade back in the 70's and I own the Vinyl copy. Master of the Universe is probably my favorite track. OK, ""Shouldn't do that"" does go on for a long time but it's a trip. This music will appeal to those that want to achieve a certain state of mind. This is spaced-out metal for those that like to explore the outer fringes of music. Not recommended for the middle-of-the-road crowd."
4,"Pros:This shaver did a fantastic job on some certain sensitive areas! It easily did a really good job where I just wouldn't trust another shaver. Really close, and super smooth. I like how it holds like a razor, it makes it easy to maneuver. It's totally waterproof so I can use it in the shower, and the rechargeable battery is convenient and lasts well. I'm also happy that replacement heads are available.Cons:The 3 attachments on this unit are almost useless. Trying to get through my chest hair was a slow process. I eventually used another trimmer to shorten it. This shaver is pretty much only good at getting the REALLY sensitive areas that you want to be smooth.Another minor thing is that the shaver has no LED to indicate that it is properly charging or finished charging. If you don't push it securely down into the charger, you might find yourself with a dead battery and a laughing wife."
4,"I gave this 4 stars mainly because the convenience/performance trumps everything when it comes to parchment (i hate those rolls!) BUT there are a few minor imperfections. (1) The sheets come all rolled up together in a rubber band - i wish they were in a flat box; (2) I have the goldtouch W.S. 18x13 baking sheets and the parchment was still a little larger than the sheet; and (3) the sheets aren't perfectly cut rectangles (just slightly off - you can tell when you fold it in half). That being said, the parchment lies flat after you unroll it and you can still kind of tuck in the sides to fit in the baking sheet. My cookies cooked great and no more trying to flatten that darn parchment!"
4,"Many of my fellow reviewers have excellent points...It is true, all of the resources you could possibly need for ""success"" on Neopets can be found on countless fan-sites, magazines, and even on the Neopets site itself.However, what you will find in Bill Gill's guide is a very neatly-collected version. No longer will you need to bookmark numerous pages, constantly having to flip between webpages. And, in all truth, that isnt a problem for some of us. But for others, with more sluggish computers, it is inevitably a /pain/.-An asset to Neopians? Absolutely.-An interesting take on several different aspects of the game? Most definitely!-Could you find the information in the book by web-surfing? Yes.But all in all, this guide can be a great help to countless fans of the Neopets world."
4,"My 4 month old boy loves his activity center. We chose it because there are alot of interactive toys to keep him stimulated compared to some others we looked at. The characters & music are also the same as on the Baby Einstein videos, which he also loves.Construction is also very sturdy...my little one is 75th % for height & weight and is never still, but we've had no problems with his activity center.Only drawback is the electronic toy...the spanish version of the animal names is difficult to understand because they're spoke too quickly and by children that don't speak spanish, so there's an accent. I am bilingual and was very dissapointed in this. It could also be improved by having all the animals light up rather than just the one in the center.Otherwise I would definately recommend this product."
4,this cable was good deal for a good price and works just fine.the delivery could have been faster.for such a small item.
4,"Good quick read.Good book to have as a reference book. Deepack takes you very briefly over what he calls Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. The very first step covers the ability to meditate,which is to get in touch with your true self and not your ego-show off self. This i found to be the major step in the book, because without mastering it you can not advance to the next steps. So i found myself highly interested into the meditation subject,all of a sudden."
4,"The drill is okay. Ive been using a Dewalt spline for years and never had a problem with it. The Makita has locked up a couple of times during some jobs but still keeps going. I do termite treatments and drill 2 to 3 hundred 1/2"" holes in a single day with the drill. Thats alot of drilling. I would recommend this drill, and also a Dewalt d25551k which has speed control and has never locked up. The dewalt doesnt look as heavy but it packs a punch. Not that Im a big Dewalt fan but thats my opinion. Oh yeah. When my Makita came in from amazon it had no permanent Makita emblem in the plastic as if it was generic but did have a Model and Serial number so im sure its not generic just made to sell at a discount. I would buy another Makita HR3851 for what i do."
4,"I purchased 2 of these plates (#1057557) brand new at $4.98 each, seemed a bit high for me. I am a diabetic and find it difficult to visually measure my portions, in particular the carbs. Anyway, thought I'd give these a try. I read the front label & the back of the plate. No where does it say microwave & dishwasher safe. That's very important to me. In reading the reviews I found that some folks state that they do microwave and others state they throw them in the dishwasher. How can I be sure this is appropriate for this type of product? I am with the understanding that, if it were advisable to do so, it would therefore be stated on the actual product? I am in need of some insight.....please!"
4,i have been fishing with garcia for years and it is as good now as it ever has been. for the money it would be hard to beat.
4,"The Boyz N Girlz United CD is great to dance to. It is fun to listen to, and it has a wide variety of styles of music. The singing is great, and the remixes of ""Messed Around"" at the end are also amazing. I love the new BNG CD, and I think any other pop music fan would enjoy it too."
4,"I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and the more gory, the better. May is one of those films, but it made me oddly uncomfortable. Watching the last 30 minutes of the film literally made me sick to my stomach and cringe. Building up that point is a marvelously acted film about lonely outcast May, played remarkably by Angela Bettis (Girl Interrupted, TV Carrie). Angelas perfect performance truly makes this film what it is. Starting off as a shy, awkward girl who only wants to have a date with Jeremy Sisto(Six Feet Under, Wrong Turn), then turning into a crazy, creepy lunatic, Angela makes us feel sorry for her and then be intrigued as to why she does the things she does. This makes the final 30 minutes all the more exciting, and sometimes unbearable to watch. Jeremy Sisto gives a strong performance as Mays object of desire, and Anna Faris(Scary Movie, The Hot Chick) turns in a likable performance as Mays lesbian co-worker. This film is the Carrie of the decade."
4,"Look at this as the Spacemen's ""white album"" --Sonic Boom and Jason Pierce each wrote and produced one side of this record; the band was essentially finished. The first side, from Sonic Boom, is clearly reminiscent of his work in Spectrum. The second side, all written and recorded by J. Spaceman, sounds much like Spiritualized. It's more straightforward and accessible than some of their earlier releases, but it's nowhere near as good as Playing With Fire or The Perfect Prescription."
4,"I've had mine for about 10 years now with daily+ use. It only required one replacement part when I got it (used) and has functioned generally flawlessly for all this time. I'm an espresso connoisseur, roast my own beans and seek perfection from this machine. A great burr grinder is essential for this machine. Overall, it does a very good job, but is admittedly finicky. FRESH ROAST, grind, tamp and extraction must all be done very well or shot quality goes funky. Some gripes are the 4-hole standard steamer tip is BAD. It can be replaced with a 2-hole (Google this issue for recommendations) that will slow down the process a bit, make less mess in a small pitcher and permit great microfoam. Oh yeah, try a few different varieties of minimum 2% milk (whole is best!) from your supermarket - some foam MUCH better than others."
4,"mcmurry has an incredible ability to simplify a complex subject. without this book, i never would have made it through this course."
4,"its a nice set, very fun and creative but the packaging isn't that great. when i received this item all the discs had fallen out of their positions. thankfully non were damaged but having to take them all out and put them back in one by one was a bit annoying,"
4,"Mike Kelly's account of the Gulf War in Martyr's Day: Chronicle of a Small War, is informative and interesting. The Gulf War was carefully planned, undertaken and won by the United States in little over a month. Kelly has carefully written about the war from behind the lines and places we weren't able to see on CNN. I am quite amazed at one point, that Mike Kelly actually swam across a river into Turkey with smugglers. Courage and bravery Mike Kelly must be commended with. His book should be given the same credit for what he went through to write it."
4,As usual Sherryl Woods provides an entertaining and enjoyable story. Would recommend this to anyone interested in an easy read.
4,"But I couldnt. This was actually a pretty decent flick. I havent seen the vampire one so I cant compare it but the story was a lot better then I had expected and the .07 cents I paid to watch it was well worth it. Seriously, this is a movie to watch when you want to have fun. It reminds me of a lot of horror movies I used to watch in the early 90s from Charles Band and the Troma guys. I enjoyed it from beginning to the end."
4,"Lately, mainstream techno-dance has been very generic (aside from notable exceptions such as Pet Shop Boys, Madonna). Most songs employing redundantly similar arrangements, sounds etc. Sonique's lead off single ""It Feels So Good"" (the clear standout and commercial hook on the album) literally breathes new life into its own genre. Sonique's soulful, breathy vocals work wonderfully with the techno-laced material on this effort. Although the album is quite varied with r&b, dance, soul and trip hop influences throughout; It may take you a couple of full and complete listens to get past the first track and into the rest of the album, but once you do, it's an infectious journey through the music. Some standout tracks (aside from the first single) are: ""I Put A Spell On You"", ""Are You Ready"", ""Cold and Lonely"", ""Move Closer"" and ""Love Is On Our Side"". Overall, a strong effort from the new dancefloor diva! Happy Listening!"
4,"While many of the special effects in this film are cheesy and unrealistic, it is a great movie. I love these types of creature flicks. Don't watch this movie expecting to see Jaws because nothing could live up to the horror and suspense of Jaws. This movie is more like Anaconda with sharks; poor special effects, good plot, and lots of laughs. Plus the DVD has lots of cool extras."
4,"It was my first experience of Elvis Cole. The story is fast moving and credible, the characters believable. I'm looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with Elvis."
4,"This is the follow-up to Lisa Unger's first novel, Beautiful Lies. I absolutely loved Beautiful Lies. It was fast-paced, the plot was intriguing, the ending was good and the characters were interesting, relatable and complex. This book was good but not quite as good as the first one. The plot sort of explodes onward from where it left off in Beautiful Lies and becomes a little bit unruly. Also, the book was a little heavy on the foreshadowing of future plot points. That said, it was very enjoyable to read and I zipped through it very quickly. I just picked up her third book, Black Out, which is not a continuation of the first two, and am looking forward to reading it."
4,"This thick, oversized paperback, profusely illustrated, is thecheapestand most comprehensive of the currently available 19th century clothing references. Black and white line drawings and photographs (for the latter part of the century) illustrate fashionable woman's attire. In many cases, details of construction are also given. The accompanying text includes an overview for each decade and minute description, year by year, of hairstyle, fabric, accessories, as well as the costumes themselves. Abundant quotation from original sources. Glossary of terms. Weaknesses (1) no attention is paid to middle and lower class woman's clothing, but this is an all too common fault. (2) No color plates, a real loss for a period when women's clothing achieved such distinctive, not to say, garish hues. Overall, this is a lot of book for the money, a good first reference for this period."
4,love the remix of sweet misery with an appearance by jadakiss. wish it were available in record stores
4,"Very rare with Picasso Prints in very good quality, Cover with some aging marks. Bought in an action house in the USA. If anyone want to see photos of the book by e-mail."
4,"First off, this CD rocks! From the powerful opening track, ""Turns to Ashes"" to the quiet, emotional closing track ""Left Hand Charity"". And everything in between. Brock Lindow has a unique vocal style, reminds me ,at times, of late 70's punk like Sex Pistols combined with modern day metal like Blindside. Whatever it is, it works. You put it all together and you get 36 Crazyfists. Buy this CD!!! Favorite tracks include ""Two Months from a Year"", ""All I Am"", ""Eightminutesupsidedown"" and ""Turns to Ashes"". Not to take away from anything else on this CD though, just buy it."
4,"The game is alot of fun, it's alot like Wild Arms 1 and 2, yet it has a more complex combat system and better graphics. There are still a few of the more annoying things in the gameplay such as the sonar like symbol finder on the world map you have to use every few steps, but the game is still alot of fun."
4,"Another Lewrie adventure This one starts slowly but (as usual) picks up once he is at sea. Two great battles separated by an adventure with a CIRCUS and its bareback rider. Well and accurately written, and a maturing hero. An exciting continuation of what is arguably the best of the Napoleanic sea stories."
4,"This record has a message, and that message is 'ladies, take off your clothes.' I put this whole style of music in a catagory I call 'Bitchin' Metal. Now where is my hairspray, fringe pants and cowboy boots."
4,This 100 foot long extension cable was exactly what I needed to reach my last camera and was easy to install.
4,"The Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Czech Dictionary is filled with great pictures of everyday items. A child or adult wishing to learn the language through naming items and learning verbs will find it easy to do with this dictionary. The pictures are cleverly illustrated, and the Czech word is given in the English and Czech languages accompanied by the English phonetic pronunciation of the Czech words. This is not a true dual dictionary, however. We wanted to give it as a gift to a Czech child to learn English. No phonetic pronunciation was given for the English words, and the English phonetic pronunciation for the Czech was confusing to the Czechs. It definitely is made for the English-speaking person trying to learn Czech; then it is delightful."
4,"Hello,i was very happy with the time of Delivery and the product itself.don know what more to say ....thanks Craig"
4,"This us Underoath's 2nd album, and an excellent one at that. The only brand new song is Ten Friends and a Crowbar, and the other songs 3 are demos of other songs on the cd. The album art is a lot cooler than the original version, and there is a dvd with bonus stuff (I haven't watched the dvd yet, too busy listening to the cd haha). Definately worth your money!"
4,ANYTHING to help my hubby understand!!!!Nice and easy to read! Quick and simple!
4,"Absolutely loved (!) Chapter 13... laughed out loud!This story has unexpected twists, delightful surprises and charming banter - a really great time."
4,"I bought and read this book as part of my self-education program on Islam. It turned out to be not nearly as detailed as I had expected, especially in its discussion of the tenets of Islam and their application(s) in the modern world. The principal point of the book is to refute the popular perception of Islam as a monolith bent on clashing with and destroying Christianity and/or the West. Still, as far as it goes it is a very useful introduction, both reliable and objective, and, as others have noted, superior to Karen Armstrong and far superior to Robert Spencer.(When I was in junior high school in the early '60s, the perceived threat to the U.S. was communism, and wanting to learm more about that pressing issue I bought a book by J. Edgar Hoover on communism. Needless to say, it wasn't very helpful, although it took me several years to come to that realization. Reading a book by Robert Spencer to learn about Islam would not be much different.)"
4,This was a gift for my friend's little boy. He loved it! He would not put the DVD Cover down. He really enjoyed it when he seen the movie.
4,"The Penn Central was the failed attempt at combining the storied Pennsylvania Railroad and the historic New York Central Railroad -- both major lines in the Northeast United States -- during a period of time in which all railroads were suffering under strict and burdensome government regulation and the obligation to carry passenger traffic. The wreck of the Penn Central led to Conrail, Amtrak, and, in many ways, the railroad industry we have today. This book is an insightful, on the ground view of the creation and destruction of the company. Very readable for railroad historian, business historian, or simply by one who enjoys a good read."
4,"I was intrigued to read this book when I learned the biographer was prevented from appearing on ABC's Good Morning America by Arnold's publicist, the all powerful Pat Kingsley. It is a well researched and written book with no agenda. I held back a star because his journey to America was fascinating and the hunt is more exciting than the kill. It made me respect him more what sacrifices he made to come to this country and I pass no judgement about being a ""boy toy"" to a septegerian Spanish prince as a means to get out of Austria. Even it was only posing, and no touching. He used whatever he had to get to America. He has nothing to be ashamed of and his children will know if he did not do what he did they would not be here to judge him. It was a big mistake to kill this book it will one day idemnify him as a dreamer who took action."
4,Easy installation.Easy setup with elevation and windage adjusting screws.Maybe 15-20 minutes adjusting for a 6 o'clock hold with 3 dot sights.Sighted for 10 yards.Will shoot this weekend for accuracy and durability.
4,"I bought this after doing several of Veena/Neena vidoes(am still doing Basic Moves and Core Conditioning). I'm currently 5 months along and when I first watched the vidoe thought, oh wow, this is quite tame. Then I tried it-boy was it a workout! Not too difficult-but I loved how she had Kegels and squats-which are important for pregant moms. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a prenatal belly dance vidoe"
4,"This book is for my Granddaugther, she loved it.The condition was very good and I recieved it in a timly manor."
4,This book is amongst others used at the Stanford MBA course as an introduction to legal issues that may arise for managers in a variety of business situations. It is comprehensive and is well illustrated with landmark case studies and relevant hypotheticals. Constance Bagley takes out most of the cumbersome legalistic language and makes the complexities of US corporate and civil law understandable.
4,the games grafics are brilliant the game play is great this game truly kicks butt I bought It a few weeks ago And I love it although the under water level is kinda difficult but I still love it
4,"This is a beautiful book about relationships, the past, and the present. Welty's language is moving while the story she builds is so wonderfully simple that it allows a reader to focus on the subtleties of character and language."
4,"""Disgruntled"" refers to a previous review and not Nosferatu.There are a number of different ""versions"" of this movie distributed by different companies. I bought the Keno version, and the transfer and tint quality are excellent. However, I had previously seen the movie with a pipe organ arrangement and was dissapointed with the orchestral arrangements on the Keno DVD. Not that there is anything bad with the music, it's just that the pipe organ creates a creepier mood for me. I then bought the Image companies offering and am very pleased with the pipe organ soundtrack, though the DVD transfer is not quite as good as the Keno. I would have given 5 stars if the Keno video and the Image audio were on the same DVD. Oh, and the audio commentary is admirable in ponting out the symbolism and stlye of the film. great movie."
4,"Great moisturizer, will say more when the product is completely used, good for winter use as well, may purchase another."
4,"Tommy feathers (a student) dies and Rachel (main character) stops talking. No teacher or sub shows up and the class runs it on there own. The class gets caught. It's a sad story from kids dying and its heart breaking to read this book, this is why I like this book."
4,"The movie is a wonderful movie and great characters and inspiring. When you are done watching it, get a good book about the real Gladys and learn why she was so loving. When faced with the hardships she went through it is not enough to feel like it. She believed in Jesus Christ who put the love in her heart to do what she did. She was complete not because of a man's love, which did not really happen, but complete in Christ. She obeyed God no matter who said what or what the circumstances were and God showed His faithfulness to her. Seek out her source of love: Jesus. Great movie--read the book!"
4,"This is a great game especially if you're already a fan of Pogo. The game play is very similar to how they are played on Pogo. Keep in mind that the challenge part of the game is way too easy for an adult. Other than that, this has been a great buy and was fantastic for a long trip abroad."
4,"I've used this model keyboard for the last two years. I very much like it, despite not being a fan of most ""ergonomic"" keyboards."
4,"While this movie lacks A-list stars, it is surprisingly good comedy! It's a fun movie with the lead character talking to the camera a'la Ferris Bueller. Too bad this didn't get a wide release."
4,"It's a good and entertaining anime but the picture it's kind of blurry or maybe its the way they did the animation. It's mature content which is great for me but this is the censored version(too bad). I love the Japanese version of any anime, I hate when the put on the English version it takes away what the original idea the producer its trying to bring to life. Enjoy this anime!"
4,The complete series of Seinfeld is a great addition to any DVD library. It comes with a very handy coffee table book summarizing the episodes and pointing out some very interesting facts.
4,"Very seldom do you begin a review with, ""This is a great CD, but certainly not his best work,"" but that's just what I'm doing. ""See Through Me"" is an awesome CD, but if you are new to Randall Bramblett's great work, I suggest you start with ""No More Mr. Lucky"" followed by ""Thin Places."" The good news? If you start with this CD you are STILL going to like it a lot!""See Through Me"" dislays strong songwriting skills (no surprise to Bramblett fans) and the music is great. The only difference between this and Bramblett's two most recent CDs is that ""See Through Me"" is a liitle uneven compared to those two.If you have already purchased ""No More Mr. Lucky"" and ""Thin Places"" then by all means buy this CD! It's excellent and still beter than 99.5% of what's out there, it's just not quite up to those previously mentioned works. I still give this FOUR STRONG STARS, but this is not the CD to begin an exploration of Randall Bramblett."
4,"The voices of Selah are soothing enough to put you to sleep, yet you don't want to miss a thing, so you don't! This isn't going to be one of my favorite Christmas cd's because I like the classics, but I definitely will bring it out each year!"
4,"If you are a serious investigator into the JFK-assassination this is the book on the history of the Mannlicher-Carcano rifles. In my work with the rifle of Lee Harvey Oswald, I have used this book a lot. My advice; buy it..."
4,"Love the mugs,they can go into the microwave also but love the design & metallic!!"
4,"The firefox series continues to amaze me with it's simplicity and beautiful documentation of the Mountain life style. The other lesson is that we all need to pass forward what we have learned and loved to the next generation and the next and the next ... Picking up the earlier FF books is well worthwhile, every one a jewel."
4,very good price nice quality...i was happy to find them at such a great deal some place's want up to $65.00 a pare
4,This book was great!! I've read the whole series... not in order unfortunely... and the books just get better. I'd recommend this to girls between 11-14... I'm now starting on the Sweet Valley High series... hope it's as good! :-)
4,"I needed to get a leg up on ASP fast, and this book got me through my first web project. It's not everything you'll need, but for server-side scripting on IIS, this is what you'll find on the desk of many developers. There's a new edition out for 3.0, so if you're working on IIS5 get that one."
4,"Perfect item to wear on those cold , snowy Syracuse days. Hoodie is not bulky or heavy and works well by itself or under something."
4,"I purchased this directly from Amazon in 2007. It cost $45 back then, and came within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping (which is basically standard shipping).It looks exactly like the picture. The size fit correctly. Nothing was damaged during shipping, and it was all new material. I only gave it four stars because the sneaker is a bit stiff, and also it feels a bit too heavy for running or walking extended miles, or playing sports. I bought these because I am a walker, but they wouldn't make good walking shoes (I think the inch of platform on the sole makes it a bit heavy). They are durable though, had them for a long while and still wear-able."
4,"This is a very delicious Chicken Helper, though Amazon ships a different version of the box, ""Italian Fettuccine Alfredo"". I've had problems with the noodles sticking together even with good stirring, but in the end it's not that big a deal. This just barely feeds my family of four because the kids tend to take twice as much as usual, so expect to use more than one box for 4+ people."
4,"I like these headphones for listening to the radio on my morning bike commute. The reason I like them may be why others don't. They really do not have great sound isolation. If you turn them off, you can hear outside noises the same with them on or off.For biking, I cut off the left earphone and only use the right. I keep the volume low so I can still hear what's going on around me. When I am using my iPhone, I put it on mono audio. Otherwise, I just make due with one side.They stay on nicely even with hats, helmets, etc.The cord is about the right length. I am ordering a second backup pair so I am ready. I am sure all of my sweat will eventually degrade them."
4,"Happy with the operation of the unit from out of the box. Other reviewers on the mark about the windshield suction cup - it is ""touchy"" at best; I bought a mount for the dash from WalMart on line to keep it from falling on my lap while driving. Only other problem is with Garmin technical support. In spite of not checking the ""avoid car pool"" box under preferences the unit will not route me on I-66 HOV lanes into or out of DC from Fairfax County. I sent in a ""help"" message to Garmin over two weeks ago and have heard nothing back from them. Overall I'd recommend the unit."
4,"I just wanted some basic, economical seatcovers to protect my cars' upholstry. Fit is snug & secure. I do wish they had openings in the sides for the seat recliner lever but other than that, I am quite satisfied."
4,"I normally just read fiction, but I liked this book. I'd bought a copy of the book to give to my Dad at Thanksgiving, and hadn't intended on reading it myself. But a six hour delay changing planes in Chicago left me with nothing else to do and I can honestly say that I was shocked at how interesting and readable it was. It was kind of like watching a whole season's worth of the West Wing, only that all this stuff actually happened. A lot of what he talked about I had just barely been aware of at the time, like all the power-sharing stuff, while other sections, like anthrax and 9/11, really opened my eyes to what was really going on. Definately worth reading."
4,"I really like this iron. I've had one for a couple of years now and finally most of the flocking that surrounds the glass has worn off, so here I am to buy another one after trying two others. I have had no trouble at all with it pulling or breaking my hair. My favorite part is the flocking (kinda like a cheap velvet)as it guides my hair (straight but curls up at the ends, medium length and fine) through the iron so it comes out straight. With my iron that does't have a comb attached to the side my hair gets flattened in the way it goes into the iron, which isn't straight. The one with a comb on it totally rips my hair out. The downside to this iron (if you have longer hair) is that it is thin, I'd like to see it in a 1"" or even better 1.5"" size too."
4,"I was overall impressed by the quality of the Fuelbelt 6 Bottle Belt I ordered from Amazon. The belt was true to size and feels very secure when worn. The only problem I encountered with the belt is that the bottles have a tendency to leak if laying on their sides while freezing. When running, the belt minimally interferes with my running stride and it remains securely in place around my waist. I would highly recommend this product."
4,"I bought two of these machines. Both my daughters bought this also. My daughters use it in their children's rooms to cut out the outside noises and it soothes them to sleep. The continue to use their view monitors and sound so the won't miss anything that may be troubling going on. My husband and i use ours to cover up the early morning barking of a dog. It works great and is so compact. My husband is on a sleep apnea machine and it covers up that noise. If your husband snores, it will help cover that noise also. My daughter tells me that the cheaper model is just as good as the more expensive one. I'm enjoying our machines. I put them in two parts of the room. Great!! If someone breaks into our house, I would just as soon not know it as I wouldn't want to have to confront an intruder. If you are asleep, they may just leave without bothering you."
4,"Immediate results. Went from ""severe"" to ""not too bad"" overnight. Within another 24 hours, I was at ""mild discomfort."" Unfortunately, it never took me all the way to ""cured."" It leveled off at ""mild"" and stayed there. After a week, I finally went to see a doctor who took me the rest of the way with prescription medication. Still keeping the Goutrin on hand in case of any flare ups though. No complaints about the product because it worked so quickly - and believe me, when you're in that kind of pain, any relief of any sort is a blessing."
4,"I purchased this product to replace another one that had worn out. I thought the new one was the same, as the photos looked the same and they are made by the same company. However, the new one is considerably flimsier though it does the job intended."
4,"""Secrets of Power Presentations"" offers practical, down-to-earth advice to help readers enhance their presentations. Written in a friendly tone, it can build confidence and skills. I recommend it to anyone who wants to dramatically improve their public speaking abilities."
4,"I like the product. Helps trim me down a little under the clothing. The rubber makes you sweat. After a couple days of wearing it, I really do feel trimmer in the middle. The immediate compression isn't as much as my steel boned corsets, but is pretty decent for shapewear. I'd say an inch plus a little more in the areas that need extra smoothing.However, I don't recommend it for all day (10 hour) wear. I'm so itchy by the time I get home. It is cotten on the inside, but it still itches by the end of the day.In terms of fit, I am a 20, usually. Sometimes an 18. I bought a 3XL. It fits fine. I am short and it does indeed go from hip to just under the bust."
4,This too was a gift. My mother enjoyed the other tape so I got her this one too. She uses it alot.
4,"Keillor is simply an excellent storyteller -- what more can I say?While this collection is not, perhaps, his best stuff (I recommend ""Lake Wobegon Days"" for beginners), the stories are nevertheless endearing and well-crafted."
4,"First of all I enjoyed the Shedaisy's one song, Little Goodbyes very much. This just enhances my love for the group's style. I like the way they sing this song, Deck the Halls. To find out what I mean you have to get it. They put a different twist to the way they sing it. They seem to take the same poetic liscense for music that Chip Davis and his Mannheim Steamroller take for their Christmas albums. I personally like the old Chirstmas classics sung and played a little different. It brings a new twist to something heard often. Buy this CD and enjoy it all year long!"
4,"I've seen this 2 or 3 times; it is far more entertaining than most films out of Hollywood. Foster was brilliant as usual.Richard Gere is not that bad. However, in all his films, he seems to use the same mannerisms and way of strutting/walking that could be identified easily without ever seeing his face.It did not seem believable that everyone in town is fooled. Also, it seems that the change of 'yellow Lawrence' into a great and brave guy is hard to believe without any explanation such as a religious conversion. His progressive attitude on race relations seems to be a Hollywood invention rather than something a Tennessee confederate would display."
4,"I wanted a readable introduction to philosophy, and Morris provided that. The book was entertaining and informative and did not throw me, sink or swim, into some deep philosophical pool. I found the author to be fair in his presentation, leaving me to chart a sovereign course. So I recommend this book. But do not follow it up with the author's recent works. Something seems to have happened to Tom Morris on his way from Notre Dame to The Morris Institute for Human Values. Today he sounds more like a salesman than a professor."
4,"bond is a wonderful music group that certainly has sparked new interests in classical music and string instruments. For the most part, their music is fantastic; however, one of the remixes on this CD just should not exist. The Sharp Boys Remix of ""Victory"" is terrible. They barely play the actual tune of ""Victory"" and lasts way too long with what they actually do play. Also, the CD seems to be too short (only 45 minutes) even though it has 2 music videos (""Victory"" and""Fuego""). Nevertheless, it is a wonderful CD, with a few new songs and, other than ""Victory,"" are wonderful remixes."
4,"The art work says it all. Its dark and gloomy. I mean this album cant compare, even close to the distance or throwing copper. When I got this album for the first time years ago; I relly liked it. But my music standards werent as high. The rock songs on here, rock but do not reach pincale highs like songs on there other albums do. The emontion and lryics arent there. The lryics and stupid and just like funny, but not cause the music is so lonley and hopless. I dont have mental jewlery but I look forward to getting it. This album is good though. Do not get this one before there others, cause this is one of the best bands ever. This realese is a good thing to add to your live collection, just dont expect the emotion you will find on the others. This would be better as an acoustic album, its sounds like a remake of acoustic songs."
4,"This book is nice and basic and explains the very basic of starting to need to go potty. For example, starts with getting diaper changed then getting his own potty seat and wondering why he shouldn't use his diaper, then he tries and nothing happens, then he has a i didn't get there in time pee accident and a accident in his pants while playing then success and they then call grandma and shop for big kid underwear. The only dislike I have is it doesn't show Henry wiping or washing hands, but we just add those words into the book. My son loves it and calls it the Henry potty book."
4,Great knife for basic s***.... no serrated base so thats a minus.... and the bolt gets loose quickly... so have a special screw driver on hand to tighten that B up :)
4,"This was a quick and enjoyable read for me on the Kindle. I loved reading about keeping house in the 19th century. It's amazing how far we've come, and yet what was relevant and useful then is still so today. I did pick up some tips, but mainly I just came away with a deeper respect for my great-grandmothers and all the women before them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hug my fridge, washing machine, and microwave now!"
4,"Not among the best of Hope's films, but still a pleasure. Filmed in black and white as all Hope spy films must be. The good news is that unlike other Hope films of this period (The Great Lover, Lemon Drop Kid), the transfer on this DVD is excellent. If only such a clear copy of My Favorite Brunette were available."
4,"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower! I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily, but also they didn't work very well. So far, OXO's version has been a big improvement: the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids, and with a simple twist, the lid is off cleanly and neatly. I have found that the unit can sometimes slip, especially with a very small lid, but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface, you should have mostly success, as I have."
4,"I've had this player for a few months now. Overall, I am pleased with it. The software has a few bugs in it but, you figure them out pretty quickly and figure out how to work around them. The player itself has only one problem I've found. Sometimes if you're playing a song and decide to switch to another song from your library it won't play it. You just have to press play one more time and it will work. Really not a big deal at all. Also, it transfers songs very quickly. It is definately bigger than an ipod but, the price isn't. I figure it is still very small compared to the books of 600 CD's I used to carry around. It is definately a good buy any way you look at it."
4,"i bought the cd because of the single ""smooth"", but the rest of the album did not dissappoint. the tracks not featuring guest vocalists are santana at his best - smooth, soulful and sufficiently modern. guest performers put their own stamp on the tracks (sometimes too much so, making you forget whose album it is), but the songs featuring the dave mathews band, everlast, and rob thomas are terrific!"
4,The purpose of purchasing Select Phone was to have a source for multiple listings in specific regions. Select Phone delivered. It is easy to use and the geographic target and neighbor search features made it a bargain. The only draw back is the limit of 2500 records for the software when exporting. Additional records must be purchased thru customer service at InfoUSA at 8 each.
4,"So far I am very pleased. It's pretty spot-on accurate. I even got on my treadmill and counted 100 steps and the pedometer read the same. It gets slightly off when going up and down stairs, but the instructions warn that and I've noticed it off by 2-3 steps. Not significant. I really like the 7 day history so I can go back and compare the week. The mileage seems off and after running 5 miles and being up and around all day once, it only registered 8K steps--oops, not quite! I don't rely on it for running anyway. I use it to pay attention to moving more...now if only I can get motivated to get those 10K steps in every day!"
4,"Sue Miller takes a mundane subject like reuniting with an old house mate, and gives it enough unexpected variation to make it interesting and believable. Jo, the once 20ish free spirit, is now in her 50s, a veterinarian, a mother, and the wife of a minister. By a series of coincidences, she runs into an old friend, Eli, and he solves a 30 year old murder mystery (in a way she doesn't expect). Her actions from that point forward teach two valuable lessons, that Eli isn't the person she remembers and that her own emotions can't be trusted. Jo, at times is an unsympathetic character, but, while reading this book, I kept thinking, aren't we all."
4,"I have this camera for 6 month now and never regreted I got it.Optics is really good, zoom works great. Has some problems focusing in low light but I just point and shoot with a flash and in 80% of cases get a good picture. Never needed more resolution as well."
4,"This is a good workout as far as power yoga is concerned. It will work all of your muscles and definitely provides some challenge (I previously did cardio and weights on a weekly basis). My only complaint is the poses seem somewhat rushed and there isn't much of a calming effect with the workout because of it. Bryan Kest's power yoga DVD (my favorite) has challenging moves, yet still promotes calmness and fluidity. This DVD does have slightly more varied moves than Kest's, but Reed seems to sacrifice the calm and fluidity that should come with these moves. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely recommend this DVD if you are looking for a good workout, but Reed's brisk voice seemed to put me off a little. Wasn't too crazy about the music, but you couldn't really hear it anyway."
4,"I thought this was a great idea and decided to get it for my laptop. It didn't work, but it wasn't the fault of the mouse. The mouse worked great with another computer. It worked great. It was my mistake because I didn't check the connections on my laptop before buying this.My advice, check your computer/laptop before buying this. It'll save you from having to buy another mouse."
4,"The set is great and my husband has all his Bond movies in one place. However, we had the first movie wouldn't work and when I wrote to you I was told it was out of stock and that I could get a refund. That meant I had to send the whole set back. Wasn't going to that so I just spent another $5 and bought a Dr. No separately and now its great."
4,"This CD took me by surprise. Nice blend of jazz, downtempo and housey tracks. Yukimi Nagano Is on a few tracks. Her voice is silky smooth and perfect for Hird's production. The first 3 tracks will get you. The truly stand out tracks are:Fading BluesMoving OnKeep you KimiI love you myGetting closerTHe only reason that the cd does not get 5 stars is that there are a couple of tracks that don't flow with the mood the CD sets. Other than that it is well worth the purchase."
4,"Jai Uttal has a beautiful voice, the music is a great synthesis of east and west; probably a wee bit too much west, but I'm splitting hairs. This person exemplifies what I personally consider to be one of life's great joys.... having a professional (at whatever), who is genuinely into what they do, do what they do for you.Anyway, he's good. And obviously a happy person, which is an added bonus that comes out in his music. Sheesh, there are so many unhappy people in this world, that the really happy ones tend to stick out. And *I'm* very glad to have Jai Uttal's music in my collection. Yup, pretty HAPPY. ;->"
4,You cant beet it for the price. Works good a little awkward sometimes in tight spot but gets the job done.
4,"I bought this book without high expectations. I had heard very bad things about the series but was pleasantly surprised by this decent first collection. It reveals a little about the new Batgirl's past and a bit about her current relationship with Batman through conflicts with various antagonists.She is an interesting character, but I fear that developments towards the end of this series is going to change that. Batgirl was a mute because her father never taught her to speak, instead concentrating all her training on combat and related skills. In his collection she meets someone who helps her to understand words. This may ruin things in the future. Instead of letter her learn to speak over a period of time, the writers are going for a shortcut. Its much more difficult to write characters who don't speak but this is part of what makes her interesting."
4,"This cd is reflective of his sets at Chicago's Red Dog club where he holds a residency. Totally smooth blends and nice selection. Favorite tracks: Track 1, Track 2, Track 3, Track 4, Track 11, Track 12, Track 14, and Track 15. I know that seems like nearly the entire album, but that's a credit to Mark Grant and his ability to keep things phat. This CD is a keeper!"
4,This item was in great condition and looked as though it had hardly been used. This is a fantastic book for community workers and I can highly recommend it!Great transaction and efficient postage.
4,"I was at ""Over the Edge"" LIVE and it was the best time of my life! I couldn't wait to see the video and once I did it was almost like the reality of being in the Milwaukee Arena! This was the loudest wrestling crowd I have ever been around! Austin vs. Dude Love is a 10! I highly recommend this video to all wrestling fans!"
4,This anti-static wrist band is worth the money. I just wish the band was elastic instead of Velcro. Will buy another once this one goes bad.
4,I am satisfied as the crystal arrived in perfect condition and is large and impressive on its simple brass stand
4,"""Deep Blue Sea"" has been an interesting and well-paced action movie ever since it was released theatrically and then onto DVD. Like ""Maverick"", the DVD cover format (keepcase) is neat and more practical than the traditional format, and the price is very reasonable."
4,"Yes, it's hard to believe someone like me would enjoy Britney Spears ...Baby One More Time album. I guess I just like the bubblegum melodies and the pretty face of Britney. Say what you will about Britney (which is a lot, mostly negative) but her musical talent wasn't nearly as bad as people thought. If it was, I wouldn't like this album after all these years.Britney has a family now, which means Britney probably won't have the urge to repeat the innocent teenage atmosphere of this album ever again. But remember this album."
4,"Excellent book! I have only recently heard about Cortisol and the roll it plays in weight gain, and Talbott does a good job of explaining how it works. I feel as though he were writing about me. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I felt he could have explained more about eating on the plan itself, instead of just giving an example for one day of meals."
4,"I bought these headphones so I could listen to music and podcasts while doing chores around the house and I am very happy with them. The sound quality is very good and the range is excellent. Despite their size, they are quite comfortable. I have worn them for a maximum of 9 hours at a time between charging and the batteries have lasted just fine. Unlike a couple other reviewers, I have not had any difficulty charging them. (You just line up the socket on the headphones with the charging tabs on the base.) There is occasional static when I'm near the edge of their range or near certain appliances (like a running microwave), but this is to be expected with any 900MHz radio device. All in all, these are very good for the price."
4,I bought this single because it went number one on the Billboard dance airplay chart. This song has 10 mixes that has just very little differences between the mixes. There is no house mix but just the same sounding trance driven beat. I am giving it the 4 stars although I shouldn't because of the lead vocals. I like the song and the vocals of Evi Goffin but there should have been about only 5 mixes on the cd. Here is the track listing:1- Radio Edit (3:08)2- Extended Mix (5:35)3- Peter Luts Remix (8:48)4- Cor Fijneman Remix (6:59)5- Jan Vervloet Remix (7:34)-- my favorite mix6- McCullen Outlaw Mix (7:16)7- McCullen Vs. Moldenhauser Remix (7:41)8- Pulsedriver's Vox Remix (6:56)9- Pulsedriver's Dub Mix (6:00)10- Ronald Van Gelderen Remix (8:30)Not bad but wished the label would have put on some different type of club mixes . That is all.
4,"This is not your everyday jazz CD. Nope.This is not your everyday downtempo/lounge CD. No way !This is your special ocassion CD !!! This is a journey that begins with beautiful Jazz (including latin-jazz) touched by smooth electronics. It then takes a soft turn into folky-bluessy-housy music (hard to tell), to finally end with some great downtempo tracks. I should mention that all of this happens while you enjoy silky beautiful vocals and groovy bass lines. This is really good music. NU-JAZZ at its best (and at its sexiest too).Groovy, classy, sexy... Just right."
4,"I just bought this cover at a very reasonable price for the purpose of a dust cover. But not for a grill. There is a real lack of covers for all kinds of equipment, tools, garden stuff, etc. This product works great for my ""pancake-air-compressor"" to keep grease and grime off when not in use. I just wish this company would not restrick their covers to just yard stuff...full size compressors, band saws, tablesaws, drill presses, cutoff saws, AC units would all benifit from this type of cover...you get the idea...Expand your inventory...there is a Big Market out there.. Most of the people I know that are in the need of such covers have to have them made by boat cover guys at great expense. At the very lease... a couple of universal covers would go a long way."
4,"My cat got a nasty case of tapeworms, and these tablets cleared it up in one pill! Only gave it four stars instead of five because it doesn't really give you directions about dosage on the package, but I found it elsewhere on the internet. Anyway, this seller was great, got the tabs pretty quick, and they were sooo much cheaper than the same tabs at PetSmart! Definitely recommend!"
4,"Same stories, same photos, different title, different cover photo.All 12 stories from ""Distant Waters"" are repeated in ""The Greatest Fly Fishing Around the World"" -- so don't buy both books thinking they're different.Nowhere that I could find is there a note that these are all stories repeated word-for-word in the other book.Unfortunately, I bought a used copy and it almost didn't pay to return it, given the cost of postage."
4,"Good purchase, good buying for the price, but...CONS: pocket Win always is slower and you need to be closing apps to keep enough memory, BATERY! you have to keep charging everyday.PROS: good resolution, excelent idea the expandable keyboard, functionality super, nice apps online like CONTACTS PRO, EPOCRATES (for medics), SKYSCAPE software. Cool you can personalize sound callers, and put photo on it (Ctacts pro soft), good reception, no compatibility troubles using it with Latin America companie`s SIM.Always recomendable, it depends on you if consider better or not than treo.Have fun and try it!!"
4,Used this fold up stand for my Epic 4G and Galaxy Tab. Both fit great. I bet you can use it for other tablets just as easily. Has a great compact feel to it. Loved the felt grips on the bottom and on the stand to prevent sliding and slipping. If the price was around < $15.99 this would be a great product and price.
4,"I enjoyed this product. Unlike the Cocoa butter, I didn't have to soften it. It is hard, but soft enough to work with. I would buy this product again."
4,"This mount works as advertised. The only problem I had was that the mounting holes did not allow me to bolt the unit directly into 16"" spaced studs so I had to use a drywall anchor. While the holes would allow such placement, the unit itself would have been offset from the center of the wall to accomplish this. A minor complaint, surely but enough to warrant one less star."
4,This one of those great classics that I did not get around to reading until recently. I found it a little hard to follow but very entertaining. I am getting tired of mindless tv and am getting back to reading more.
4,"This is a good reference book, but is not a good start for developers who want to get familiarized with XSLT and XPATH. this book helped me to find what I was looking for and was unable to find in other resources including MSDN which has the worst documentation when it comes to XSL in general and XSLT and XPATH syntax in particular.On major drawback is that this book doesn't provide the user with complicated examples that utilizes different XPath functions.If you want a single reference book this is your book."
4,I like this recipe book but am not sure why they felt it necessary to add some items liked deviled eggs that don't even use flour or sugar to begin with. I expected to see only recipes that needed the substitutions from flour and sugar.
4,"Fascinating show...naturally it was cancelled. Worth buying the DVD. All the actors are good. The premise is a bit ""out there"" but it was entertaining and different from the normal, predictable show on TV."
4,"I have enjoyed all of the previous Bridgerton novels, when I heard that Colin was going to be paired with Penelope, I thought how odd. It works! All of the Bridgerton stories have been highly enjoyable. Lady Whistledown is finally unmasked, what a surprise. I enjoyed interaction between Penelope and Colin. The book added greatly to my appreciation of Julia Quinn's work. Every lady should have a life's work."
4,"I used this unit to replace the rats nest of telephone wires that were twisted together in my basement. If you're not installing this unit inside an enclosure, it is a little work to remove the plastic connectors with a pair of wire cutters. Otherwise there are zero complaints. The unit is sturdy and looks like it will last a long time. Highly recommend using a standard punch-down tool."
4,"The sheets were everything I expected, and more. My husband likes them; one of his favorite sheet sets.I did make a boo-boo, and bleached them. They didn't hold their color very well when bleached, but they're still comfortable and fit well."
4,Purchased the book recently even though it is the 2004 annual sourcebook. We purchased several and the youth worker love them. Excellent resource.
4,"Depending on your tolerance for pain, mind numbing arrogance and stupidity, you might not want to see another minute of George Bush, but with Will Ferrell starring in this final hour as Bushy, you might change your mind.With all the pain and suffering we endured during Bush's 8 years, we deserve saying good bye with a smile. Enjoy!"
4,"This is the story of a man who is searching for a fallen star so he can deliver it to his 'true love'. This is an fun tale. Gaiman has such a unique voice, I guess it is one of those things that you reckognize and become attached to--like Stephen King's works.There are various adventures working their way into the plot--they are all on a collision course, creating anxiety and a buisy climax. I really enjoyed it, and if you like any other work from Mr. Gaiman or the genre then pick it up and read."
4,"The only negative is that the numbers get rubbed off very easily. I tried to rewrite with a permanent marker, but that rubs off even faster. I'm going to try taping the numbers on next. The cage seems to be made well. No problems with balls falling out.I bought it for a birthday party, and I had a table of full of children as young as 3 playing for a long time. They loved it. My son loves to spin the cage and read off the numbers. Great for teaching number and pattern recognition."
4,"Of course my godson played this game all the time when he got this for his birthday this is one of his favor games as well. he still plays it alot though, cars is his favorite at the moment!"
4,Verry happy with these binoculars purchases them for work to view sku numbers on boxes stored of er 12 feet high
4,"We have this product and it works great. We first bought the complete system w/ latch and it fit in our Expadition perfect. It easaly swapped to our Tarus as well. It is very simple to install if you have the latch system. I have yet to try the seatbelt system and would probably vote against using the carrier with a seatbelt. I would rather have the system anchored to the car than hooked up with a seatbelt.I am confused as to one reveiw saying this product does not work. You have to level it out due to the automobile car design, not the babyseat flaw.The one flaw is the sunshade which is poorly designed."
4,"The very first chapter of this book caught my heart; when I reached the second chapter I turned back to the first chapter and read it again, just for the beauty of it. (Swede has a moment with a goose that is so well captured, I can't even put words to it.)The second to last chapter of the book is out of swing with every other chapter in Peace Like a River, and it bothered me. Most of the book is a story that you're following along with, but this chapter was very much like one in The Last Battle by CS Lewis when everyone runs toward paradise. Very weird and out of sync.From the event the night that Davy goes to jail onwards, I had no idea how the book would end or how any closure could occur. It happens, but not in a way that I would ever expect."
4,"Just when you think life is going to kick you, or Becky Bloomwood, while you're down, something changes. Following the mishandled finances of Miss Bloomwood is a hilarious escapade. Though it took me a little while to become involved in the story, once I was, I couldn't put it down! If you have ever buyed something impulsively, you will definitely understand this character. Through all of the different trials and tribulations, through denial, and then self-realisation, you follow the witty Miss Bloomwood.If you are interested in a light-hearted piece, this is the one for you. I haven't laughed as much with a book since Bridget Jones's Diary. Confessions, is another work of British comedic genius!"
4,although the film is a bit dated (appears to have been made in the 80's) the information and research presented in the film is priceless. Interviewed are doctors and researchers who explain the effects of alcohol on the brain. Also discussed are the legal consequences that occur when alcohol is abused.* recommended viewing *
4,"Einstein was a great read - I gained a new appreciation for Einstein as a person and his scientific world. In the beginning of the book, I didn't know quite what to think of Einstein. I couldn't tell if he possessed great confidence or if he crossed over to being arrogant, and I wasn't impressed with how he handled his personal relationships. However, as the book went on, I gained an appreciation for his thirst for knowledge, his independent thinking, confidence, determination, and even kindness"
4,"Reading this book is like roaming through 2000 years of the Roman empire and all the transplanted Romans who grace the US. I loved it and I'm not Italian. And, sorry, Leon, but I don't even want to be Italian. I've got a better idea. Why don't you do one on Jewish or Irish people? They're pretty entertaining. The book probably deserves five stars, but I'd like to see some graphics in it, so I just gave it four."
4,"i really like this translation of the New Testament. it is very easy to understand and reads like a novel. the division into these short ""15 Minute"" sections are a great incentive for me to read it every day. to have someone elses commentary along with the text, helps to inspire my own thoughts and insights. i also like the references to the old testament, and i frequently look up those scriptures to gain a better understanding. this little book makes a great gift. i can only recommend it."
4,"Once again Robin Jones Gunn makes us long for this sleeply little town! She does a great job of introducing us to Leah and Seth, updates us of all the characters from the first six books and puts it all together in a fresh, wonderfully told story. She even solves a mystery from Secrets, Book One of the Glennbrooke series! If you liked the other six, you will love Woodlands and long for another trip to Glennbrooke. Oh, just so you know, the scripture reference should be 3:17, not 3:1.....what Chapter? Grab a Dove Bar, read the book and see! (ps to Robin - you can tell you live in the NW, you describe the weather perfectly!)"
4,"Okay to start, I'm not doubting that Gavin Degraw is quite the talented musician, but OH C'MON! I was reading reviews of people on here and I bet about 3/4 of them are girls who just watch MTV and don't know any good music besides this. For example, one person said this ""Another plus about Gavin is that in concert he sounds just as the CD with a little more ""umph"" to his songs. He will change notes around, hold out notes longer in concerts, but it sounds beautiful"" I'M PRETTY SURE THAT ALMOST EVERY ARTIST DOES THAT LIVE (well if they have talent...so I guess all you MTV girls do have something to get excited over, because almost all the music on MTV sucks except for like 1/100 songs). Again, I am not doubting this CD is quite good, it's just, he's not a god. He does have quite the good voice but he needs to bring out more talent in the music, it's just too poppy for me..I give it 3 1/2 stars"
4,a nice educational toy for my 9 year old.teaches basic electronics with simple experiments.stimulates the young mind.my son loves it.
4,"We bought this swing after my daughter was 2 months old and I had suffered with a regular battery swing. The batteries always ran out and the swing motion was just to fast for me. I wanted a plug in swing that also had two different motions and my husband picked this one out.I am SO glad he did. Sometimes my daughter wouldn't sleep in her crib and once she went down in this swing, she was out. Yes the music (on low) is loud, but you don't notice it after awhile.I will say that we keep it in one area and haven't had a problem with the stability of the legs. The mobile and lights will sometimes go out, but I think that is a button issue and not the motor.Would I get this again....in a heartbeat. My daughter is now 7 mo. and is getting to big for this and tries to get out of it all the time. I'm sad to see it go, but I'm glad we had it for as long as we did. Well worth the money!"
4,Tuck Everlasting was a great book. The way Natalie Babbitt describes theTucks is awesome. The Tucks are very calm and quiet people. They probablywould not be the ones you would suspect to be doing weird things. Winnie Fosteris also a favorite. She is a very passionate little girl who is kept from playing withother people outside of her own fence. On a hot day a little girl runs away from home.Then finds out a secret that she is not supposed to know. Then there is a very mysterious man that appears.I think this was a great book. The details are really cool. I would give this book 4 out 5 stars. This was a great book I laughed. I cried. This is my review on TuckEverlasting.
4,"This is a great book but I would rather know more facts about Wren, Walker, and Morgan than I would have about Coll and Par. The begining starts with Cogline, his character bothers me at the begining also, but he becomes a different person at the end. And Walker is a non-believer, but soon realizes what needs to be done whether he likes it or not. Par jumped straight to the challenge and didn't realize the consequences, and Coll wanted nothing to do with the visions, it just didn't blend well. Wren rejected everything about her past she didn't want to believe, but soon realized the truth and wanted to know more. Other than those parts this is a really great book."
4,"Living faith is ensconced in systems of belief. Here is more than an introduction, providing in depth, interesting writing about faiths of the living world."
4,THE BOOK GIVES A GOOD INSIGHT TO THE HISTORY OF THE LAPD.....IT LETS YOU INTO CRIMES THAT HAVE HAUNTED THE AREA FOR YEARS AND GIVES YOU AN APPRECIATION TO THOSE WHO HAVE TO WEAR THE ACTUAL BADGE.
4,"I enjoyed Murder in Volume. Being a female scientist who grew up in the Texas Panhandle, I felt a connection to the main character. Although it is relatively easy to deduct the murderer, the motive is what I found to be both interesting and unique. I am looking forward to further issues of this series!"
4,"She is a wonderful Southern story teller. Her characters have warmth and everything wonderful in life, with some spice mixed in. It's books like these that are hard to put down and sad when they end."
4,"&#65279;The Princess Test, by Gail Carson Levine, was a well thought-out and carefully expounded version of Hans Christian Anderson's The Princess and the Pea. It made a good read, but was rather short, giving slight room for those important `little' details such as character development. Levine told her tale in true Anderson style, much like the original story, but with Levine's humor and clever twists to the plot. Those who have enjoyed Levine's previous book Ella Enchanted will finish The Princess Test and clamor for more, but if you are not familiar with Levine, you may wonder what all the fuss is about."
4,"I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like the book, but as you get to know the characters it grows on you and by the end you say ""I really enjoyed that"" it is alittle pat at the end, but then again it is fiction. I will definately try another from this author."
4,"For Those About to Rock gets a bad rap. People expected Back in Black 2 and that just wasn't going to happen. What they got, however, was an outstanding follow up to one of the greatest metal albums ever.This album is much edgier than back in Black, harkening back to the Highway to Hell days. The songs are heavier than Back in Black on the whole and have a much darker feel.The title track is a staple of AC/DC live shows to this day, unfortunately, because the overwhelming consensus is that this is a 'weaker' album, they don't do as many of the other tracks as they should. The lesser known tracks that are standouts from For Those About to Rock are Evil Walks, C.O.D., and Let's Get it Up.If you buy this with expectations, you may be disappointed. If you buy it and just take it at face value you will have discovered a gem that is often overlooked."
4,"I have already reviewed a couple of Gerald's previous projects with the overriding sentiment being that Gerald fares much better as a premiere session man rather than the centerpiece. Yet since I made that observation about 3 years ago, his solo projects have been consistently solid. Before, I could not imagine sitting through an entire Gerald Albright set simply because he tended to pale in comparison to the David Koz's, George Howards, Dee Browns, or even Kim Waters for that matter.But lately, Gerald has produced some quality projects, showcasing inventine sax work in some sparkling arrangements. This project is no exception and is actually the best work he has submitted in a while.Gerald shines with his spot-on choral sax arrangements and his band is top-notch. If you are a smooth jazz sax man/woman, this project will not disappoint.Nice, inventive work!!!!"
4,"The letters are great. Shows what kind of person Reagan was from the very beginning, how he thought and how he progressed in life. Too bad his editors (with all their pedigrees) didn't take the time to check out the facts. Pg 161...Gene Autry did NOT own the Los Angeles Dodgers, He owned the Los Angeles Angels. (now the California Angels)"
4,"While this book begins a story and leaves it hanging, it is the real thing. There are very few books that create a compelling alternate reality, although many authors try. Garth Nix' characters seem real, and the magic also seems real. Not quite enough is revealed about the way the magic works, or the history behind it - the way Tolkein never said much in LOTR about the other rings, or other wizards. Nix gives you an inkling, but not an understanding. In Lirael there is less time spent in death than in Sabriel. If you read Lirael, you will wait impatiently for the next volume."
4,"the author gunther does a magnifent job of affording a history of the evolution of jazz, this in a most scholarly fashion. thus making at times somewhat academic effecting a use of words whose understanding may be elusive to the ordinary reader."
4,"As Insurrextion whent on the air Commisioner Regal annnouonced the card was changed, so the main event would now be a handicaped match for the World Wrestling Federation Championship featuring; The Undertaker vs Trilple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The undercard was OK, but nothing special like the UK undercards are, So on to the main event. Most of the match,The Undertaker was in control, but in the end he pinned Triple H, so Stone Cold Steve Austin kept his WWF Title. Overall WWF Insurrextion was a pretty good event, and I would recomend buying it."
4,"Love the way this coffee maker keeps the coffee really hot. You can program the amount of time you want it to stay warm, start times of course. It makes a great pot of coffee - and it looks cool on the counter! Also love that there is no carafe to break/replace. I would give 5 stars except for 2 things - (1) the filter is hard to insert properly and (2) it's difficult to get the water in without some spillage, at least until you get the hang of it. I have not had any trouble with drips or leaks so far... stay tuned to see how it holds up with our very hard water."
4,"This is a relatively good smoker. It works well. The instructions were easy to follow and the cooking times listed are surprisingly accurate. However, the smoker is very cumbersome. You cannot pick it up and move it all it once but instead have to move each piece separately. Still, it worth the price."
4,"I had looked at the GeoTrax train system before Christmas for my 4 year old son, but my husband and I felt like it may be a little young for him. Then he received one as a gift for Christmas from a family member, and I am so glad he did! He LOVES trains, and like another review I read, owns tons of Thomas-based wooden train systems, but loves that this train makes sounds and goes on its own. The bridge is a little touchy and does not fit well together, but that is the only down-fall that we've noticed. He pulls it out constantly and is able to build the track on his own. I am now on the look-out for additional track pieces and accessories for his birthday at the end of January!"
4,"ok, so the music world has progressed. so what, how boring/how much would you rip them if all their albums sounded like one. Its called getting older. With age comes maturity(sp?), which is what blink 182 have done here. There are still songs to please you die hard ""Punk"" fans, but not so much a punk, but a post punk feeling. This is probably my favorite so far of all the blink albums. Plus Robert Smith(The Cure) provides guest vocals, that rules."
4,"Though not my area of interest I do know a few friends who would appreciate this explicitly detailed guide for growing your own herb. Don't let explicit detail throw you off though - this is easy, step-by-step stuff complete with graphics, lists and everything you need to know to get started.To give an idea how detailed this gets the book gives you the low-down on what pH levels your water needs to be, the type of lighting set-up, fans, lamps, soil... even what kind of system you need to protect your garden.Discretion, of course, is the most important tool you'll need and it was nice to see the book even has a whole chapter dedicated to etiquette. Frankly, this book has everything one needs to know to attempt this. I doubt there are many others out there that can compete."
4,"This is my second pair of these, I find them to be a bit narrower than I remember, but I am hoping over time they will give a little."
4,"This was exactly what I was looking for. I had a number of black and white photos of different sizes that I wanted to group together. And this worked PERFECTLY. The frames are good quality and look nice, not cheap at all (like the price would suggest.) I'm very happy with them!"
4,"This has everything you would expect from a history of the West: whites against whites, whites against Native Americans, Mexicans against Americans, Texas Confederates against New Mexico Federals and everybody against smallpox. The axis of all of this is the singularly humble, principled, enigmatic yet flawed Christopher “Kit” Carson. A man’s man in every sense of the word, expect the instance where he probably shot some guys in cold blood."
4,"Received merchandise promptly and price was ok. Did not realize that they were alkaline, not Hg batteries, which would have lasted longer. Might have bought differently had I known. They'll just run out more quickly on my Laser boresighter."
4,"This is a sorely needed book for anyone in the process of managing or introducing an automated build process into a development team. There is nothing ground-breaking here for experienced managers, however, it's a great reference book and covers all the major areas of concern regarding the build process. I've also found it to be a very useful resource to help build consensus in the team regarding the why the need for a build process and how to define it. This neatly fills a void in the book market."
4,"I was hoping this book would be both beautiful and frightening, but it really only met the beautiful criterion. It's really more of a snapshot of a fair in Chicago in the late 1890s, including a lot of somewhat clinical and scholarly information about the fair and life in Chicago at the time. The murder and madness aspect of the story is a bit underdeveloped and actually quite boring. The characters were not really developed that thoroughly, as I found myself wanting to know more about what made them tick. On the other hand, the quality of writing is excellent and the book moves quickly enough to hold the reader's attention. Overall, still a pretty good book. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
4,"Great value. Usual HP quality, reasonable price. Be careful to cover printer when not in use. Dust enters through vertical paper feeder and can cause problems - double paper feeds and poor print quality. Otherwise excellent!"
4,"I know I really like a book if I can read it more than once. This book falls into that category. I think the plot was fantastic, if maybe a tad unbelievable. There was plenty of action and suspence, and I loved seeing the modern world through Jessie's old-school eyes. I like reading alternate reality fiction a lot, and this kind of had the same feel because the world was new to Jessie. Overall, a nice, quick read."
4,"I quite enjoyed this. Although there were anachronisms aplenty, it is true that there were women physicians during this time. The clues were fairly obvious, but the use of herbology, use of Chaucer's poems and the position of women during the time was very interesting. The characters were good, particularly Kathryn's servant Thomasina and I didn't mind either the secondary plot or the budding romance between Kathryn and Colum. It's a light, quick read good for a Sunday afternoon."
4,"I thought this movie was so cute and after I saw it I thought how great the music was. It's a compilation of new songs and some classics like ""Let's Stay Together"" by Al Green. In answer to the Music Fan's question, the song from the promo is called ""Don't Dream It's Over"" by Sixpence None the Richer."
4,"I needed an external HD to backup my 5 year old laptop so I purchased this drive. I was concerned about whether or not it would work, since I only have one USB 1.1 port and there were some reviews that said the drive might need an extra port if you didn't have enough bus power on the computer, however the drive works fine on my laptop. My only comment is that the WD Sync software that is included is not a true BACKUP program, but is designed to synchronize files, so I just use Windows XP Backup."
4,I'm pleased with this product. It was an easy install and looks good. The only thing is that it doesn't get all the radio stations that we listen to.
4,"This is a wonderful album full of beautiful, melodic songs, a very tasteful backing band on some songs, Patty's great guitar work, her haunting voice (with occasional overdubbed harmonies), her smart lyrics ... in short, the album is great.I saw Patty live in NYC a couple of weeks ago. She was terrific, was a riot between songs, the audience was enraptured. She is an incredible artist, deserves better recognition, and this CD will not disappoint."
4,"I gave this toy a four star because....I bought this slinky for my two 1/2 year old daughter. She likes it, however I think she might be too young for it. I was having more fun showing her what it can do. It brought me back some memories. I think it is still a cool toy. I would just store it till she is a little bit older. I think every kid should have a slinky sometime in their life. The toy is just like I remebered it...it is durable & slinky."
4,"I missed this in the theaters, but my wife, my daughter, and I caught it in a hotel room--and loved it, in spite of the scan-and-pan display and lousy sound. So I rented the DVD, and found the movie even more hilarious than the first time.I suspect those who don't like ""Bandits"" were expecting something entirely different--maybe something more like ""Dog Day Afternoon"". ;-) This ain't it. It's a quirky character comedy that requires a keen mind and a keen wit. Definitely worth the time. ..bruce.."
4,"I have used several types of gloves for my arthritis and thought this would be good. I use a medium quilters glove, because of wrist size, and bought the same size in this. What I never thought of was the size of my thumb. These stabilizers have a really tight thumb opening and I had to cut the sewing and make them wider to fit - otherwise, my thumb went numb. There is more to these than just wrist measurements when determining size."
4,I purchased a set of Bose headphones about a year ago and that's about how long they lasted. One day I put them on and the left speaker would not work. I paid well over $100 for them. The Technica set is great. They are much more comfortable on my head and the sound is nice considering the price tag. I am still afraid to really kick up the volume for fear of blowing a speaker. I use them every day on my treadmill. Would recommend this product.
4,"I love the book, The Count of Monte Cristo. This a twist of anime with ""alien/space"" characters. I only got half way through so far, thought the beginning was a bit slow, but it's getting interesting now."
4,"""Psmith Journalist"" is the third Psmith novel and finds the hero cavorting in the New York City of 1914, as he unilaterally takes over a weekly newpaper, runs afoul of politicians and gangsters, and consorts with other gangsters to arrange for his protection. This sounds rather grim but actually Psmith continues to delight us with his humorous language and indomitable aplomb. As with the other early novels the final plot resolution is rather weak but not without being preceded by a hundred-odd pages of hilarious dialog and action. Moreover, the book provides a fascinating glimpse into the New York of a distant year, with which the author was intimately familiar."
4,This Girl Briteny Spears has a incredible voice and she is vary butiful and talented and is my insparation she is my model cause i am geting into the music carier and so now i look up to her and oh ya Buy any *N SYNC cd you do not own Cause i own them all LOL and Email me cause i love to make new friends and well thats it ~Maria~
4,"This was such a great book. I couldn't have made it through my first year in the classroom with out this book. 8 years later I still employ the concepts that Clark emphasize in his text.Its perfect for the new teacher who is struggling, or a veteran teacher who is looking for some new ideas or a bit of professional development. This isn't for all teachers, but there is something for every level of teaching"
4,Good if your not going to be on your feet for a long period of time. Good for errands & light yard work.
4,"As someone who has read loads of Historical Writings about the early Church and what the Gospels are about from a non-theogical point of view, I found much of the research in this book weak. In fact, I wished Spong had talked about the churches in the United States that have allready gone down the path that Spong suggested and what has happen to them, i.e. Christain Science and Unity. It is, however, a easy read and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting to question what is happening in traditional churches and why."
4,"First off, the picture is misleading. HATCH does not make these knee pads in Woodland digital, which shown in the swatch. The digital they are talking about is ACU Digital, that is what I received. When I contacted the seller about it, they said HATCH supplied them with the photo and were willing to take back the knee pads.BUT, these knee pads are excellent. They are comfortable, sturdy and very well made. They do not slip when running (they have a neoprene pod on the inside to prevent slipping. Once you adjust the velcro straps to the correct size, the quick attach clips are very easy and quick to use.I sewed Digital woodland fabric onto these knee pads so they are now the color I wanted. It was a pain, but now I have the color I wanted and on a great knee pad."
4,"I had one before , however through use the split and I had to get a long narrow stylus. Thanks"
4,"I used this book many years ago when I was in high school during the summer. I was a very chunky 16 year old who lost 30 pounds in 3 months. I was proud of myself but this book made it easy. The recipes were good, you could eat what you wanted as long as it fell within the week's parameters (pasta one week, veggies another, etc.) The diet even works for those that take a birth control pill since it takes both natural and ""artificial"" cycles into account. I have been recommending this book to friends even though I haven't used it in years. When I find it again, I am intent on using it again. It was successful the first time, why wouldn't it be again?"
4,"This past December I found myself in need of a cargo bag for a one time, 2000 mile drive. After researching different options (all with price tags in the $100's of dollars) I stumbled across the rain ex. I thought I would give it a try. I was shocked at how much baggage it held and how easy it was to attach and detach from my Blazer. (Although it held so much cargo that once it was off it was hard to manage due to the fact that its a bag not a shell) We went through a few rain storms and not a drop got inside. I was more than pleased with its performance and anyone who isn't simply isn't being realistic for the money. I would recommend it to anyone for one or two time use on a major trip."
4,"this book is all it should be not only documenting the series/episodes but the text mirrors the feel of the show ,frustrated and funny. there is a photo from each episode discussed . the book was in great shape ,arrived quickly and was had for an unbelievable price."
4,Works great. I got a set of casters for it now it works even better. Price it out you can get it with the purchase of a saw.
4,"I was hoping for the inclusion of Dave Brubeck Quartet's hit of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" because that is nearly impossible to find on a CD. Otherwise this CD is a nice selection of holiday favorites done by Dave on the piano."
4,This book has helped me in my Sunday School teaching as it has shown me how to make the stories of the Bible more interesting for the children.
4,An album that came from a very special time of music during the early 90's. Not a single bad song on this album that never requires skipping. An album you can play for almost any occasion and that never grows old. Nothing fancy but a very solid rock album with very catchy songs that I believe even the radio still plays to this day. Highly recommended
4,"I picked this book up after having read it decades before. The writing and analysis remains as crisp as when I first read it. I believe the strengths of the book are in the great amount of details provided about the military blunders that occured on both sides during the first month of WWI. Its really an always-topical cautionary tale of how egos, a reluctance to engage in diplomacy, all coupled with the fog of war, can play havoc with the best of plans. The weakness of the book is in getting a better sense of the German perspective other than with Tuchaman's occassion expressions on the essence of the German people. Tuchman does give equal play to the German strategy but she falls into far too much stereotype about the German ""character"". While she doesn't dwell on it, she seems all too comfortable in explaning German acts as part of the German belief that efficiency trumps humanity, as an example."
4,"I've skimmed through Monkeemania: The Story of the Monkees and am hoping to find Monkees Tale by Lefcowitz in a store near me! And it's funny how a reader who reviewed this book is from Beavertown, PA, where Davy Jones currently lives.. Isn't that weird? ;)---*doreen*---"
4,"The first third of the book plods on and on as Bishop does a brain dump on every little detail she can think of to describe her world, which is interesting - but not that interesting. Something kept me going and after clearing that hurdle I was caught up in an original story with characters that I finely came to care about since their storylines were no longer being interuppted every other paragraph with yet more info on the dark jeweled society. Some will no doubt be offended by having Saetan Lord of Hell as one of the heros and the growing romance between a 700 year man and a 12 year girl. The one thing that bugged me about the book was that there were all of these characters that were hundreds and thousands of years old and yet they still seemed to react to life as if they were in their 30's. You would think they would be rather bored by now and perhaps be just the tiniest bit wiser. But no matter, I am looking forward to the next installment."
4,"I have grown increasingly bored with the never-ending stream of ""chick-lit"" books that spew the same plot in different formats. ""Bookends"" sat on my bookshelf, along with a few other unread titles, for quite some time as I have refused to waste my time with another Bridget Jones wannabe...How surprised I was only one chapter into this novel..not at all what I had expected. This book reminded me of the beloved Maeve Binchy books- with strong character developments and an integrated plot centered around many characters as opposed to just one.This book was rich and fulfilling, not shallow and mildly depressing like the chick-lit which has permeated our society. Anyone looking for an uplifting change from the usual- pick this one up! You'll read it in two days."
4,I have two large dogs (a lab and a rottweiler) who destroyed the doors of my beloved 4Runner. When purchasing my new Ford Expedition recently I was determined not to let the dogs ruin this vehicle by keeping them confined to the back. The partition was a great way to solve this issue and installation was relatively easy. However due to the size of my vehicle and the fact that I have captain's chairs for the second row instead of a bench seat it was difficult to get the ideal level for the lower bar so that my lab couldn't wiggle her way under it. In the end my husband had to make some adjustments to the bars using a hacksaw but for the most part it has worked out. It doesn't rattle which is a huge plus and it is really well made. This item was definitely worth the investment but I just wish I had known before purchasing it that it might be an issue with the 2nd row captain's chairs.
4,"My mother has been in assisted living for five years. She is not well enough to get a regular shampoo where you lay your head in the sink. I have her regular stylist visit her and use this on her hair. It gets it squeaky clean and the stylist cuts her hair. When the stylist is not available, I do it myself and I never have any difficulty getting her hair clean.Comfort Hair Shampoo Cap"
4,"This is reprint of a 1999 issue of Journal of Consiousness Studies. It contains exciting articles by stellar writers like Benjamin Libet, Henry Stapp, David Hodgson, E.J. Lowe, to name a few. It covers areas in neuroscience, quantum physics, and philosophy. Expectedly, many conflicting views are presented. The most interesting, as a matter of course, are those of compactibilism. Saying that, there are indeed also some articles which are quite obscurantist or of uncertain relevance. This cannot be avoided due to the nature of the publication. Four stars."
4,"So the subject matter is a little odd! Iles gives us his usual skills in writing a suspense thriller. It is a little disorienting to read a book in which you continually ask ""what's going on?"" instead of ""who did it?"". Maybe that's the idea. In most books we're usually quite comfortable while the characters are in deep trouble. Reading through this book will leave everyone a little uncomfortable."
4,"I assume that these digestive enzymes did the job. Hard to tell. But the formula contains HCL, which I already take separately, and I found a formula that contains more enzymes and no HCL, for a lower price. So I switched to the other brand."
4,The 715 is a dependable laptop. As a first time buyer of laptops this system ran faster than I thought and had all the perks of a Desktop with the DVD/CDRW drive the large keypad and the fast processor. The only flaw I can find it the Graphics display on the screen. It uses the modern Thin Film Transistor screen but it doesn't seem to be very clear....however the visuals are amazing for DVD movies...go figure.All in all this is a great laptop. A little bulkier than some but not heavy. Good for the internet too. with tonnes of speed.Although I do a lot of programming I haven't as yet used the system for this and I have no idea how it works with a dual linux boot. but the AMD chip is apparently designed for Windows XP so it might run slow with another type of OS.
4,I bought a black vornado vh2 in dec 2001 and have used it in my bedroom every winter at night . the thermostsat goes to 55 deg on my home furnace at bed time. only problem i have had was the thermostat sticking on the vh2. they use a crude bimetal thermostat on my unit. I took it apart one time and repaired it. it's worked fine since.it's been a great unit and I would purchase another but after reading reviews I thought maybe they cheapened them up.I had 2 pelonis original ceramic disc heaters previously and this unit has been far more trouble free and cheaper (initially) for me.....
4,"I have to admit, the more I read Connie Willis' stuff, the more I enjoy her. The short stories in here display a very nice range, from frenetic to despairing, and they're all handled well. ""The Last of the Winnebagos"" is really a very moving story, much more than I thought it would be since I'm not a dog person. ""Even the Queen"" and ""In the Late Cretaceous"" were hilarious - the latter indicates that she must have worked in academia at some time in her life... ""Jack"" is an interesting piece, especially since she lets us figure out Jack's secret long before any characters do. There are a few rough points here and there - ""The Schwarzschild Radius"" and ""Spice Pogram"" come to mind, but they're easily made up for by the other stories in the book. Good reading for a long night with some hot chocolate...."
4,I love this snow but I thought I was getting a lot more than I did. I bought it for my daughter's preschool class and of course they loved it. Overall it is good I just thought I was getting more for the amount I paid.
4,"I have taken various kickboxing classes so I am accustomed to the various combinations that this workout applies. However, if you are a beginner or not totally coordinated you may end up finding yourself spending more time trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing rather than sweating.To me a lot of the strength training was a waste - not enough repetitions to really get any burning feeling.The cardio is decent a few times I felt a bit winded and I would definitely say that this is a fun work out - fast paced and the instructor is upbeat and pleasing to listen to.I was sweating by the end of it but wasn't as thrilled with the workout as I was hoping."
4,I saw the trailer on my computer the other day and I must say that this movie could ACTUALLY be something that is QUALITY. Of coarse I said the same thing with Attack of the Clones. Man was I wrong with that crapper.
4,"This is the first book I have read by Ms. Monroe and I thought it was very enjoyable. I was a bit surprised that others here rated it so low. I suppose I can see how some people might find Alex too overbearing, but I love a good alpha hero and he's the perfect example of one. And Isabel is a sweet heroine that the reader can identify with. If you are a fan of hot love scenes and attraction at first sight, then I would say this is the book for you."
4,I am not one that usually buys books like this but I thought it mught be interesting. This book was much harder and more intense than I had thought it would be. I knew that I did not have an exceptional vocabulary but I did not think it was average. This book proved me wrong. The book has a great layout and works through the words in a progressive manor. With I little time you can improve immensely. Good luck.
4,"Very informative book, a must have for any pilot transitioning from pistons to turbines. Each chapter gives precise details of what the airlines would ask you about systems etc..."
4,"The new solo CD from former Twisted Sister frontman is a true throwback to the old school. In this age with all the rap-metal, punk-pop, and industrial metal sounds out there, its downright refreshing to hear an artist staying true to his sound. This album reminds me of Twisted's Stay Hungry album, but a bit heavier in places. The opening track ""Hardcore"" is a scorching tribute to Lemmy from Motorhead, one of the best tracks on the album. I would have preferred another original track as opposed to Dee's cover of the ""Wanderer"", but he actually pulls it off. The hooks and riffs are memorable, and transport you back to a simpler time when metal was metal,and not diluted like it is today. I would have preferred a couple more fast songs however, as most of the album is mid-tempo. Still, for fans of Dee and Twisted Sister, this is recommended."
4,"If you are not a birder this book would be very dry and probably meaningless. However if you bird, even casually, you will be enthralled and eager to get your binoculars out to travel far and wide to catch a glimpse of only a few of the 8,000 species Phoebe saw."
4,"The year was 1992 and the song that really grabbed my attention was a single named ""It Hurt Me"" by Jacci McGhee. I have never been one to purchase a CD for one song, but I went right out and bought this one. What really drove it home for me was the video she was in with Keith Sweat. The song demonstrates the pain she was feeling and I felt it. Jacci McGhee is so underated as a singer and song writer, I have listened to the other cuts on the CD and there are some really good music."
4,"This is a good video. For SG1 fans, it will be most enjoyable. In fact the way it was produced/edited is more like a feature film. The difference is subtle but it is there. Possibly it's to make the video more appealing to those unfamiliar with series as well. But this just my hunch. I'm not a movie expert.If your an SG1 fan or just a sci-fi fan, it's worth the purchase price.Bill SwingleJanesville, CA"
4,Best of Pros: you never need a battery! This is just awesome.Worst of Cons: The strap isn't soft enough in my opinion.
4,Nothing special about this shoe other than it is a silver flat. I do like the ornament on the toe of the shoe. Hope it doesn't fall off!
4,"The basic plotline of this story is that Raneaf is an orphan who discoveres that he is actually a ""Demon Lord"" and that Eclipse, who found him, will be his teacher and mentor, teaching him how to become an evil demon rampaging human villages and the like. The only problem is that Raneaf is the cutest sweetest boy ever and that he becomes a laughingstock of the demon world as well as Eclipse who is a very highly ranked demon. However instead of hating Raneaf and that fact that's he's lost status by being his teacher, Eclipse becomes incredibly fond of him and this wonderful relationship ensues. I really like this manga; though I am bothered at times at how feminine the characters are drawn. I would stare at new characters for minutes trying to decide if they were male or female. Raneaf is so cute and funny and of course Eclipse is mysterious, forbidding and alluring. The two of them together is pure magic; the kind of relationship that is so captivating in manga."
4,"Even today this book is a good intro grad-level text. It covers reactions based on oxidation or reduction, and covers stereochemistry of nucleophilic additions, etc."
4,"This text is somewhat difficult for the computer novice. However it does take one very slowly through the steps required to start writting code. The explanations areclear and straight forward. For learning how to write code for the web, this is the place to start."
4,Instructions are a little fuzzy but the idea seems to be good and to work well. Would buy again.
4,"Wow! This is a total 360 from Ignorance IS Bliss. They are back with their normal selves. This album is more punk than Ignorance Is Bliss. I heard some of the songs they put out on the internet for fans to vote for, and I knew this would be a great album. It was very cool how they had the fans vote for which songs would be on the album. They dedicated this album to all of their fans. In my opinion the best song on the album is Shame On Me, or Disappointed. Then the rest of the cd is awesome. It is not as good as their self titled, which will probably always be their best."
4,i used this hairdryer when i was on vacation with some friends and one of them had it. i don't actually own it YET. but i plan on purchasing one. FYI if you want to buy it at a store instead of online i saw it at Christmas Tree Shop the other day for $23. I'll be getting mine on amazon because I have a gift certificate. Can't wait to have my very own <3
4,"This watch looks great (except for the weird circular inset). Seems to keep decent time. Love the (mostly) leather band, except that it is too short for average wrists. Other annoyances: the day/date readout is too small. Precious LCD screen space is taken up by a useless barber shop-type scroll bar at top. The auto-light function doesn't stay set. Otherwise, very nice watch.Update: After 2 years, I'm forced to get a second one of these. My nephew has taken mine, claiming it is perfect for his needs. Seems only fair that I get the newer one, although the battery is still strong on the 1st one."
4,Good things come in small packages they say. Well this is certainly true for this compact little shortwave radio. Reception is clear and the sound is good quality in all areas.
4,The movie itself was good..worth watching again and the quality was great. I was a bit disappointed that there is no disc. I will probably not buy a movie this way again. My family likes to pass movies around and this is just a pain to do as well as the fact thatif the web goes out for some reason there is no way to retrieve it.
4,"a little smaller then i thought,however you did get quiet a few with package. very easy to apply. stick well. i would buy more."
4,It's a memory card. It works fine. It came free with the camera. What else needs to be said.
4,"This is a good product. We only drink tea and enjoy the many different types and blends of loose teas. In the past, using only my electric kettle, I found it difficult to get the water temperature and steeping time right for the different types of tea. I frequently got the water too hot and steeped too long. Now our tea is perfectly brewed every time. My only complaints regard having to hand wash the components and also I would wish for the capability of making a larger amount of tea - 16 oz. only allows for one cup for my husband and myself."
4,"I am the satisfied owner of two canon printers (Pro9000 and MP620) and am a relatively low volume, high quality printer user. I can't add anything specific regarding the quality of these inks, however I would like to point out that while the price is less on Amazon, Staples does have a very nice recycling program for used ink cartridges of all types. I would say that tossing these when they are empty may not be inline with Amazon's new greener packaging initiative, and return mailers (uninsured, and not tracked) may be a cost-effective way to improve overall user experience for this product."
4,"While walking the Strip in Las Vegas I heard the most beautiful music I have ever heard (I'm a mobile D.J. I've heard a lot) It sounded like Angels singing. Across the street the Bellagio fountain show was in progress and they were playing ""Time to Say Goodbye"". I bought the CD the next day. It is now used for background music at the wedding receptions I D.J. Many people have come up to me and asked who this is and where can they find the CD. If only all the good things in life were under $20.00"
4,"I'm going ahead and upping my rating of her Etudes to 4 stars because they are better than her Preludes. I can't remember if it was Friedman or Hofmann who refused to record all the Etudes because he said that no one pianist could do all of them justice, but after listening to many pianists efforts, I'm inclined to agree with him."
4,"I DONT CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT CHER, BUT I ENJOY THIS MOVIE SO MUCH I GOT IT IN VHS AND NOW ON DVD.EVEN THOUGH ITS A BIT CRAZY, IT HAS A CLITCH TO IT. LEARNING THAT HER BOYFRIEND HAS TO GO TO PALERMO FOR HIS MOTHER BED-DYING SIDE AND IN THE MEAN TIME LEARNING THAT HE HAS A BROTHER NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT.NICOLAS CAGE COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER PREFORMANCE BUT HE IS GOOD.IN THE MEAN TIME SHE LEARNS HER FATHER IS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A LADY THAT ONLY WANTS HIS MONEY AND HIS ATTENTION.IN THE MEAN TIME LEARN THE MEANING TO LIFE AND CHOOSING TO LIVE INSTEAD OF LIVING LIFE WITH OUT NO MEANING."
4,A classic that has been around for generations of the past and the future. This is well-written literature that can serve as an example for current authors.
4,"Family loved getting several packs of these in their stockings! Created lots conversation with adults and enjoyed by young folk, too."
4,"I had the privilege to see Michael Scheuer speak at the AQ 2.0 Conference several weeks ago and his panel discussion convinced me to pick up his book. The book raises several vital points in that despite three years since 911, the United States still isn't regarding the War on Terror as a real war. The strongest point is his insights on the perceptions of the Arab World and how Bin Laden's message is crafted to appeal there. Where the book falls short is that he identifies too strongly with the AQ and the Taliban and completely discounts our ability to influence them."
4,"This is a great funny movie , love it watch it over and over again makes me feel good...."
4,The book keeps you hooked on the story wanting to know what happens next.... I am not disappointed in the ending
4,"despite His Sound Changing quite a bit in the Late 70's&80's Grover Washington Jr played with alot of Feeling.""Mister Magic"" Alone can be put into any Mix&still Rock any House Party.He had a Cool,Smooth Soulful tone that is Missed.a Good Introduction to a Artist that Went Way too soon."
4,Definitely enjoyed it. Very cleverly done with some very funny moments. Another great Wes Andersen flick; if you're a fan you won't want to miss it.
4,I bought this camera so I could e-mail photos to my family and use them for web pages. I would not print out pictures for framing but do use it to print out small images for greeting cards. My expectations of this camera were limited to the money I spent. The supplied software for this camera makes it easy to get images into my computer and highly recommend using this for the first time user or someone that doesn't need a lot of features.
4,"There is nothing wrong with the gate itself. It did't work well for us because of the base trim, making the bottom of the doorway a different width than the middle."
4,"The drawers in my apartment are long, narrow, and shallow, so finding an organizer that would work in them was definitely a challenge. The price for this one is definitely right, so I ordered it, not knowing for sure whether it would fit in my drawer. Well, it does, and I'm very pleased with it! All of my silverware (flatware for 4) fit in the compartments, and the extra compartment can hold things like ice cream scoops or measuring spoons.The only reason why I'm not giving this product five stars is that, when it arrived, the mesh in one of the corners was dented in. I applied some pressure to the area and was able to fix it. There was no damage to the thick metal bars, which are the ""scaffolding"" of the organizer.If you order this product and it doesn't fit in your kitchen, you can still find uses for it, so don't send it back! It also works well as a school supply or jewelry organizer. You can even use it in your cabinets to hold small items like teabags or spices."
4,all i could ask for in the recording mode.i would have given it 5 stars if the screen was easier to read
4,"The whitestrips worked pretty good. I experienced no sensitivity, and only minor burning to my gums. I can't really say how well it works long term, but the short term effects were good. Overall the product is a great value and a good buy."
4,"It's easy to slam Mark Burnett. He's freaking rich, he's changed the way television does business, and he doesn't seem to make a wrong move careerwise. But unlike other self-help authors who use adventure anecdotes without having any experience of their own, Burnett has put himself out there. I was surprised to see that he was on the front lines in the Falklands War, finished ninth in the Raid Gauloises, and personally scouts each Survivor location and pre-runs each Eco-Challenge course. The guy's not a wanna-be, he's the real deal. His words on success are worth reading."
4,"All London office worker Richard Mayhew tried to do that evening was help a damsel in distress, but he got more - way more - than he bargained for. Neil Gaiman has spun another magical mystery tour from the elements of the mythological quest paradigm. Underworlds, eternity, horrific beasts to be slain, labyrinths, immortality, heroes and antiheroes - it's all here in modern form, but nothing crucial really changes, does it? Reading this book is like watching a movie in your head. And through it all, the hapless Richard discovers a well of personal courage that he never thought existed. A timeless tale of humanity's existential search told anew, skillfully written and highly recommended. It's a trip!"
4,They came well packaged and undamaged. The details are beautiful. The balls themselves are a little smaller than I wanted but that's my own dumb fault for not reading the description thoroughly. They're still great and work perfectly.
4,"its not the greates game ive played but not bad,im on the 2nd mission,ill probly finish it....ron"
4,"This book is very fun to read. Even though it is a quick read, there's plenty of depth to the characters and the two plots. It's a form of literature that leaves you smiling and then after you've put the put the book down makes you think about its significance."
4,book arrived 5 days earlier than expected. book is very cute and simple. good for children who speak french or french students.
4,"Trying to put off fixing my bunion, this product seemed like a good possible solution. I've been wearing it nightly for a couple of months, but missed about three days this past week.When I wake up in the morning, my foot looks almost normal. By the end of the day, it is back in it's distorted shape, but I seem to have less pain from the bunion than I did before. And last week, after missing a few days of wear, I had quite a bit more pain in my foot.Overall, it's not a magical cure, but it does seem to be a good way to manage the pain of a bunion. And I am still hoping that over time it will retrain my foot back to a more normal position. I do recommend this product!"
4,"I won't bother to talk about the plot since it's covered by all the previous comments, but I do want to say that ""Jack is back!"" (and I don't mean Jack Bauer). I've read all the previous six Jack novels and Wilson has yet to run out of steam.This may sound strange, but I would like to see F. Paul Wilson do a Jack novel without the supernatural element, where Jack just does his ""repairs"" on the bad guys ala Equalizer/Godfather style. Most of his books have such subplots unrelated to the main supernatural one, and I find these quite entertaining. I bet Wilson could pull it off."
4,"So far I've used this mainly for edging my lawn, cutting around sprinklers and drains. It works great for that. I replaced the manual roller edger and grass shears. My neighbor has had one for a while and he's still using it, mainly for trimming shrubs and even trimming trees by attaching it to a swimming pool handle."
4,"This is my second mystery by this author in this series and I liked it as well as the first. Harris does a great job of making you feel like you're right there in this small town in Georgia (I think Lawrenceton was modeled after Covington). Detective-character Roe Teagarden, formerly a librarian, is now a lady of leisure, since she unexpectedly inherited quite a bit of money. She's looking around trying to find herself, and is trying out being a real estate agent in her mother's firm. Just as she's deciding this is really not for her, she discovers a body in a house that she's showing. When another body is found in an empty house, people begin to wonder if someone is going around killing real estate agents.The plotting was good and I was a bit surprised at the killer. But mostly I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of this small town and interesting inhabitants."
5,This book separated the romantic notions of owning a B&B from the business end. It was eye opening and very informative.
5,This is a great TV stand. Holds my TV very well. It is easy to clean and moves freely. I highly recommend this product.
5,My friend and I rented It(were both Ten). We both liked it... and her mom(she was their)also enjoyed it.My mom has seenit before when I watched it on cartoon network.I've also seen Scoobydoo on vombie Island. END
5,"you'll run, not walk to buy this model. It is very well designed and easy to understand. Construction takes a bit of patience, but you won't mind as you watch the Gothic spires and buttresses take shape as the Cathedral rises before you. We made a pilgrimage to Chartres after the September attacks and found solace in this very pure Gothic wonder. The book has nice black and white photos, and of course, the glorious 13th century stained glass is not represented well, but a visit to Chartres itself would fix that."
5,"Although I originally read this book for Professor Jolly's class, I have since recommended it to friends and family as an excellent, well rounded introduction into human evolution. It tries to examine, in an objective way, the degree to which natural selection has affected both physical and psychological human attributes.Unlike writers such as EO Wilson who seem to argue that science has little if anything to learn from the humanities, Jolly believes that a comprehensive theory of human nature needs to draw on both the sciences and humanities to arrive at a synthetic view. I agree with her view that we cannot reduce humans to their genes, but nor can we ignore the role they play in our behavior.The book is quite well written, and draws liberally on poetry, short stories, and politics as well as science to illustrate her points."
5,"Albert Wendt is on faculty now at the University of Hawaii, and he and his wife are wonderful, friendly people. This book is an early (1973) partially autobiographical novel of his love for his wife. He's a Samoan immigrant to New Zealand and she's a white native. The cultural gaps are bridged with considerable sensitivity to all parties. The book has aged reasonably well, but it's a far less mature work than the author has produced more recently."
5,"I bought another optical cable because I need an additional one for the cable box optical out to the audio receiver. I already have 1 cable that I bought from Best Buy in 2000 & I use that one for the DVD player. This cable seems to be better than the older one I have. The audio comparison between the 2 cables was noticeable. I was watching I think PTI on ESPN & tried switching the cables back & forth a couple of times. The audio, at least that's how it seemed to me, was louder with this cable. Don't know if they wear over time or something. I heard that optical cables don't like to be bent due to the fact that light can't bend. But I've been pretty careful with the other cable. The shipping was pretty quick & the price was good. I'm happy with my purchase. I would recommend this cable & Belkin's a good brand, you can't go wrong."
5,"Ever since I picked up a copy of the, then as yet to be release Crow movie soundtrack, and then a copy of the graphic novel, I've considered O'Barr's work a modern masterpiece for the ages. Nevermind all the trashy sequels designed to capitolize on the original soulfulness of the original. Fear and Bullets is a dark opus that takes you to another world, while some of it may be a little too metal/industrial sounding for some, it is none the less the perfect accompaniment to the graphic novel."
5,"Touching, moving. Grab a box of tissue. Invite friends and family. This is quite an eye opener as well as overwhelming at times."
5,"This is by far the best C++ book I have ever read. It is comprehensive, explanations are simple and to the point, and, up-to-date. I am referring to the 4th edition, of course. The earlier editions might be a bit outdated."
5,"The Matrix is one of the most unbelievble movies ever. I just loved every minute of it. At first, when I saw it at the cinema I was saying to myself: ""Man, I oughta get this movie on DVD once it gets out, it was just amazing!"" And so I did, I got the DVD the day it went out. The sound is AMAZING! Especially on a new AC-3 system. My advice: GET IT NOW!"
5,This book is an inspiration for any woman that thinks she can't do it. Every woman in this book proves that every woman can do whatever she wants - and do it well.
5,I think this is a great way to learn words you don't know that are ahead of you current learning path which allows you to be consider high in vocabulary level by you fellow colleges/students.
5,"I have to say, I adore this book.The way each word was carefully crafted to fit in with the rest of the story was wonderful. It offred a fictional but realistic vision into the Nazi era in France. Nicole Burns, a highschool girl in the 21st Century, is time warped into the life of Nicole Bernhardt, a jewish-french teenager living in the Nazi reign on Europe. This book is factual, yet easy to read. I would definetely reccomend it."
5,This CD ebbs and flows so well. I feel happy and sad and excited at different times. I love that it is all instrumental. Nothing hides or covers the music. You can listen and really get into it or use it as background.
5,"These are THE BEST hot rollers for longer hair that I have ever used. The larger size is perfect for adding body and volume, plus they heat up in less than a minute! The first time I used them I got compliments on my hair. I highly recommend these."
5,"One of the problems with military history is thereader tends to get one side of the story. Oftentimes, those who fought on opposing sides areviewed as sub-humans. Just like how the film""Das Boot"" showed German submariners as humans,Guy Sajer does the same with the German soldiersin ""The Forgotten Soldier.""When reading about the Russian Front, the readerexperiences the bitter cold and unbearable suffering.The reader feels sorry for what Guy Sajer and hiscomrades experienced. Another heartbreaking storyis the hungry German soldier hung for eatingabandoned food earmarked for the German officercorps.""The Forgotten Soldier"" brilliantly tells the storyof a Frenchman who fought with the Germans. Thisbook should be read by all those in the military,for it does a masterful job of detailing the humancosts soldiers must pay in combat"
5,"I liked Ekko from the CD Sunset Magic North - with the amazing Mossman Elongation, what a beautiful creation - and since I keep looking for one of his own CDs. Not dissapointed from the samples. Thank you, Amazon, I will be checking to see if some more Ekko shows up here.KA"
5,"HI: The spice girls came out ten years ago as the pop sensation of the 90's. They are a talented bunch of musicians and singers!!!Songs are catchy and easy to sing along to. I really like them. It's not too rockish, and not something you'd fall asleep to. Forever has a great deal of nice songs. I especially like : Let love lead the way, and Time goes By.> Great job by the Spice Girls!!"
5,"Being an avid amateur boxer, I was constantly plagued with sore knuckles and hands for constantly hitting the heavy bag day in and day out until I got these EverGel Hand wraps. The cushioning for the delicate bones of the hand is phenomenal. They don't offer much in the way of wrist support though, but simply wrapping the hand wraps with traditional boxing gauze fixed that problem easily. As stated in another review, these wraps are designed to be worn inside boxing gloves, not by themselves."
5,We had a very similar hibachi as a kid growing up and taking it everywhere. I was at the folks place last year and I saw it sitting there. That hibachi has got to be 35 or more years old. The storage bag seems like it might be hard to put on the hibachi when it is still hot. I will use this hibachi alot.
5,"This is an excellent and sometime inspirational biography. Lowenstein writes so well that it's a genuine pleasure to read. Many biographies get bogged down in details, or spend many pages on irrelevant details. This one moves along at a brisk pace, giving the reader an excellent understanding of the man and his beliefs. I encourage anyone with even a passing interest in Warren Buffet to read this."
5,"Have been wanting to buy this for sometime now.My question is, with new ""complete concert"" series.Will this ever be expanded to the complete show? Or is this the complete show?"
5,"Heroes was a good show, but then again all good descent shows don't really last that long. I have watched the seasons and love rerun DVD watching."
5,"Syntha 6 is great, It is so fine that it does not clump. The result from your workouts will show very quickly."
5,I had been looking all over for this I had a copy but someone stole it I also knew the Singer/bass player Greg Acuna but have lost contact with him anyway glad to have found a new copy
5,Great step by step book that helps children create paper airplanes. Punch out parts to create airplanes are included. Creative fun! Such a wonderful alternative to electronics!
5,"The Keys to Growing in Love by Gary Smalley combines three books, The Language of Love, Love is a Decision and The Two Sides of Love. He presents a ""workable, biblically based plan of action for building loving, lasting relationships"".If you are looking for solid, faith-based help for your marriage, this may be the book(s) for you."
5,"Art Alternatives provide excellent sketchbooks and drawing pads. I had the hardcover sketchbook in high school and it was excellent. This pack is worth it! The hardcover, by itself, cost me $15 in high school, and that was the price for one in a class bulk set. If you're looking for a few good sketch books, You won't regret this buy."
5,"I've bought 3 of these for full-size violins. I've had excellent success with them for the most part. One violin did require some adjustment of the bridge height, and I shaved it down some. On my electric violin it didn't work out very well, but I've been very happy with these bridges."
5,"My husband and I were informed that our 8 year old son with Spina Bifida (myelo) and hydrocephalus has NLD. So many red flags have flown high for years now, but I continued to be reassured that he just had learning delays and that we just had an overly emotional child with a knack for tantrums. This book has lifted a large amount of weight off of my chest. Incredibly written and so informational. I know that we have a long road ahead of us (it has been a long road already with his other diagnoses so this is just another hurdle), but I feel much more confident in our ability to try to at least guide Q through life as painlessly as possible. Thank you Pamela for giving me some hope and especially for the guidance!"
5,"Item was as described and shipped promptly. We have had some trouble finding these locally, finding them on Amazon was a pleasant surprise. This is why I love Amazon, it's easy, correct and shipped right to me, on time, fairly priced. What more could you want."
5,"This was an excellent book! Only problem is, I like to share books I love and have given all my copies away. Still I feel I need more to give to my favorite people - Has there been a re-write? Has anyone out there read any other books by Justin Scott - how do they compare?"
5,The book was as described and sending the purchase was fast and professinonal. I would like to do business later on with this company.
5,"I was not going to bother to write this review until I saw some of the negative comments that had been written. I disagree with every negative review. I found the book to be excellent; well worth reading. The comment about ""knowing that the defendant was innocent"" misses the point of the book. It's not a cheap murder mystery where the only fun is trying to guess who the murderer is"
5,"Through these easy to learn, catchy songs with various styles, children learn teamwork, the benefits of being nice and helping each other, and even though we are different in many ways, we all have common threads that connect us to one another. Thus, the first song on the album, ""I Am Not So Different"", which all the kids sing and understand. This multicultural album consistently connects with my early childhood students. It's absolutely superb."
5,"This album is amazing. Every song is a classic. It's a lot less rock than the bends or pablo honey, and a lot more sad, but it's better than both and if you haven't already done so GET IT NOW. It will change your life."
5,Geoff Emerick was there for the creation of the Beatle sound. It is well written with enjoyable person information.
5,"This book of 30 chapters teaches 10 SAT vocabulary words at a time, giving multiple approaches and practice to master them. I use it with my 10th grade gifted English classes and love it."
5,"It was great reading a book I could so completely relate to. I've read the ""beats"", I've read the ""hippies"", and I've read the early ""punks"", but until I read Salad Days, I'd never read a book about me, my friends, and our generation. Though I didn't always like our hero, I couldn't help feeling very connected to him and his story, and that's the key to any great book."
5,"I've been reading and studying this book for several months now and am sure I will return to it over and over. It is full of great advice, direction, and examples of how writing is (and should be) done! Probably the best instructional book on writing out there! I only wish it were available for my Kindle. :("
5,"I purchased several Dynamo's this Christmas; three for woman to use in their cars for emergencies, and one for myself, because I got tired of needing a flashlight, only to discover that the batteries were dead. No more!"
5,"This magizine is wonderful, and I was very pleased with how it had many explanitory issues. I learned alot and it will help me study for my future career in zoology and animal behavior. I incurage young readers to buy an annual subscription to this magagzine."
5,Anthony Newman makes Bach exciting.He may not satify the purest but I never get bored listing to Anthony playing Bach.I love the use of lots of reed pipes.I think I probably have every Bach cd and record that Anthony Newman has made.I have over 1000 organ cds and records and Newman is definitely my favorite Bach player.
5,"I love Julia Quinn's witty historical romances, and have to disagree with many of the earlier reviewers of this particular book - I really enjoyed Turner and Miranda's story. Miranda is a charming and eminently relatable character. I love romances that begin with a crush from afar (and Turner is particularly crushworthy)."
5,"This book is what I have been searching for. I have noticed a connection between the foods that I eat and my mood and my mental alertness. I could not find an exact pattern. Dr. Wiley spent 20 years of research to figure this out. Dr. Wiley isn't one who is easily persuaded by small amounts of evidence. He demands proof. This book is worth it weight in gold. Buy the book, take the pH test, change your diet, change your life!"
5,"I have all of Chis LeDoux's albums between records, tapes, and CDs. This one has always been one of my favorites, right down to the picture on the cover. The title track has always been a fan-favorite LeDoux track. Along with it, there are the old-time concert staples, Six Bucks A Day, Lean Mean And Hungry, Hippies In Calgary, and the cover of Night Rider's Lament. This album is a great representation of what Chris was back in 1978, without sounding stale or overdone. Basically, you can split Chris' career up into two parts... 1972 thru 1989, and then 1990 thru 2003. This one is obviously in the early part, and it shows well. Fans will know what to expect, and newcomers will get a perfectly painted picture of what they might find on his other early albums. Other standout tracks include Getting By A Quarter At A Time, Cowcamp Blues, and Ain't Had Time To Go Home."
5,"I was a battalion commander and glidermen in the 101st Airborne Division for the D-Day operations. I was also one of the consultants for the movie ""The Longest Day"". Over the last 50 years I've endeavored to read as many books as I could on the subject of D-Day, Airborne and the American and British gliders used in the D-Day operations. ""Glidermen of Neptune"" is the most accurate, clear, consise and lucid accounts of the D-Day glider operations I've ever read. It is an excellent book and an invaluable resource on the subject. I recommended it to my son, who is an instructor at the War College and uses it as a reference book in his class. I applaud Mr. Masters for his fine book."
5,"I bought the game this weekend and while I have only put in about 2 hours of playing time I am EXTREMELY impressed and can't wait for the hours to whither away at work so I can go home and play some more.If you've played Heroes II or Heroes III get ready for a VERY different game. Although they have lessened the number of monsters available in the game they have significantly raised the quality of the monster in the game. Almost all of the monster's have special abilities or some unique trait, even the lowly peseants.The playing controls all still seem to be there from the older games however they are moved around the screen some to give more screen to informational things and maps.Overall it's a VERY cool game and I'm glad I paid the price to play it now instead of waiting 6 months for the price to drop like I usually do."
5,Delightful book - great for an older reader to share with a younger listener! Sweetly connects generations.
5,I love this book and bought this one as a gift for a friend. Henri Nouwen clearly explains the importance of retreat and time alone to recharge.
5,"I have worn out and been through so many pairs of ""Good"" Tactical gloves it is not even funny. Just a few no brainer's here on a good all around tactical glove. The glove should not cause any additional stress on your palms when using your digits. The glove should act as an extension to your hand allowing you to freely move your digits, feel your digits under all circumstances and be tough so that it will withstand the abuses you put it through. This glove is it as it meets and exceeds all the above and more. I would highly recommend these gloves as an addition to your tactical gear."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read on patterns and object oriented programming. It gives you a new perspective about design and helps you to write your programs with change in mind. I highly recommend it.
5,"This is probably the only place I have seen a bad review for Dexter on. This is great Show and everyone I know absolutely loves it. The first episode of season one take a while to pick up, but after it's smooth sailing through the rest of the seasons. It's a psychological thriller, and at times it can be a little gruesome but it is the best show I have seen in a while."
5,This cd was very good. It was techno and I really like techno. The lyrics were pretty X-rated but all-in-all it was a marvelous cd! Two thumbs up!
5,It has the features that count and gets the job done unless you're using this for a busienss perhaps. Great for home use. This would work well with Rayovac's new Hybrid series NiMH batteries.
5,"After an extremely long wait, 'Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix' is finally out. And it was well worth the wait. This book isn't only the longest one in the series so far, but it is the 'deepest' one. Not only did Harry grow up, but J.K Rowling has written a much more 'grown up book' than before, to match Hary's growth. Don't worry, we still get a lot of the details about life at Hogwarts that made the previous books so charming. But we also see that the wizarding world isn't black and white: good people can come from good families, but people we thought were good might also have their wild side. That adults can make mistakes (even out of the best motives) and might not be able to reveal their reasons when you ask. But most of all, this book shows the importance of values like family, friends, loyalty, and most of all - love."
5,"I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"
5,"I saw this mini-series when it aired on HBO, and when the DVD set was available at the library, I checked it out and watched it twice. Finally, we broke down and bought the set; its worth three times it's price! My six year old enjoys watching it with us, as he has an interest in anything related to space. Each episode is wonderful, providing accurate information about the Apollo space program within the framework of vivid storytelling. The acting is top notch; it's hard to believe these guys didn't actually go into space themselves! For entertainment or educational purposes, From The Earth to The Moon is a must see by anyone interested in the space program, or in the mood for good drama."
5,I love this video. Great performance. She's such a great performer live. Hands down this is a must own.
5,I have reviewed two issues so far. The articles are practacal and challenging. Well worth the investment for someone working on a manuscript.
5,"Finally something different and great. Everytime you watch it, you'll find something new to enjoy."
5,This was great. I used this for my Sons eagle scout ceremony and was a wonderful addition. The cord was a little shorter then I would have liked. It was well loved and will be used for the holiday season.
5,"Really neat info on how insects keep warm/cool down and why they move in those ways - shivering, bouncing, etc. The text is really easy to read and interesting to get into - the drawings sprinkled in throughout help make understanding that much easier. I don't have a science background - just have an insatiable hunger to learn about our natural world and this book definitely filled one corner of that hunger......Ever see a dragonfly stand up like its doing a headstand? Well its not because it like the head rush (or maybe that too but the book doesn't talk to that) - the reason they do that is on p. 66 - ""When the sun is directly overhead some dragonflies assume the 'oblisk' position, which minimizes surface area exposed to solar heating while maximizing the area available for convective cooling."" ....all to say, it was a hot day and the dragonfly needed to cool down :) Excellent book!"
5,"I don't watch the vampire diaries, but my daughter does so I can't give it a true rating. I know it keeps her glued to the tv for hours. She loves to tape them and watch them all at once but for one reason or another some episodes didn't tape. I gave it five stars just for the fact that this is an option if something else goes wrong."
5,The Bay Area has so much to offer and this author doesn't miss a beat when it comes to hiking. Fabulous hikes with varies degrees of difficulty in gorgeous locations. I love this book not only for its detail but also for the informational sidelines along the way. I feel like the author is hiking alongside me. It's the bomb!
5,Iloved this book. I couldn't put it down. it was so interesting and such a thriller. Iloved pages 23-45 that was the best part and was so so so (I can't describe it )...
5,"What is the Bleak House? It is an old mansion, home of John Jarndyce and his three wards: Ester, Ada and Ricard. It is also the squalid conditions of Tom's-All-Alone. It is the bleak out come of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce. It is the Victorian shame of an illegimate child. There are many bleak houses in this book.Bleak House carries a warning against the excesses of nuisance suits and the danger of a laisez-faire government which it wraps up in a delightful albeit complex and dense comedic romance of a young woman supposedly orphaned and sent to live with her guardian who is stuck in a generations long lawsuit over an estate. Interestingly, I recently read an American story that obviously borrowed heavily from Bleak House. To anyone who enjoys Bleak House, I recommend The Big Mogul by Joseph C. Lincoln."
5,"This book is a gem. It's tender, clever, and deftly written. It's wonderful for reading aloud. I had trouble finding it for years, and I'm so pleased to see that it's available again."
5,"Chris Genoa is, as advertised, a literary lunatic. And if he keeps writing bizarro books like this he'll be my favorite writer in no time flat. Someone recommended this book to fans of Adult Swim cartoons, and I can see why. Foop! has a lot of that same brand of crazy humor you'd find in those cartoons, but with a nice literary touch. So it's good and good for you. Highly recommended for fans of bizarre humor and really for anyone who likes to laugh."
5,"This book is an excellent reference for the beginning gardener. Instructions are easy to follow, and the reference tables at the end of the book are wonderful."
5,"I am officially addicted to ""X&Y."" This CD plays like a great movie. It has these great cinematic melodies with larger than life orchestral like sounds. This album has more of an epic quality. It just operates on a grander scale. ""X&Y"" could be a feature soundtrack. It's so Oscar worthy. Coldplay created something that has more than one dimension. I just feel like there are so many different levels and reveals. At times it's very intricate with lots of little flourishes and details. This CD requires repeat listening just to absorb it all. The title is sweet and simple, but the overall texture is inherently complex. The presentation is very straightforward and it all blends and flows very well. Therefore, it's very accessible and enjoyable. But if you really pay attention, you'll discover different geometries. It's not redundant. All of their songs are very interesting. Their music draws you in and takes you places that you'd never expect. It's like a great fairy tale at times."
5,"Very cute, realistic, and the striped pole adds a special touch. Another winner from Melissa and Doug!"
5,READ all the reviews - the tips are amazing - when I followed what other people wrote - I had an amazing successful experience. I have a HONDA ELEMENT (05) and I did EVERYTHING that was BLACK - and that means the entire lower part of the vehicle. It not only looks like NEW - but I can't stop looking at it. It has stayed on (now 2 months) - and it looks natural (not shiny). Please remember to TAKE YOUR TIME - I did one area a day - so that makes it easier to do an excellent job. A few times I had to go back over places when I saw small streaks - sometimes I used the larger foam throw away brushes. I even did my windshield wipers. I got so hooked on the look - that I couldn't stop. Clean well and let dry first. If you've got the patience - you'll have a beautiful look. PROMISE!
5,Great family movie. Get the kids together and watch the movie with them. Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda show how it really should be to raise a hugh family. Great humor.
5,"this is beautiful music, well worth the price, I bought it used and it played like new. I would recommend this music to anyone who loves good guitar music. Great for background music or even to listen to before sleeping. to relax with."
5,"I purchased this for my 5 year for Halloween and dress up. I came in 2 days and was great. We ordered a small for my 5 year old and it fit over his clothes nicely. the shirt is stong material and looks good and the pants are very light weight, but haven't ripped yet. It cames with 2 scarfs to go with the the outfit. it does NOT come with the sword. Worth the money! My kids are still playing in it 4 weeks after Halloween"
5,I loved it! The experiments are so much fun! They were interesting and fascinating! A *Must* for any scientific youngster.
5,Great color - green and bright and works well. I will always love le creuset quality and buy it when I can.
5,"Really fun to see Nev in his awkward stage and to come to know how he got his start in Internet un-matchmaking. His internet crush was so messed up. I love how Nev always tries to walk in the other person's shoes, find the positives and work things through with people. A refreshing opposite to most reality shows which try to destroy friendships or lives for the ratings. Also, liked finding out where the term Catfish came from."
5,"I prefer this album to Sgt Pepper, being much more consistant. This music is some of the finest that they've ever recorded. This may be considered to be the beginnings of their solo careers but the Fabs flex their creative muscles and everything they've learned up to this point shines through. Some day, Capitol needs to get this classic album remastered and the CD booklet needs a great deal of annotation, perhaps by Marc Lewisohn or the Beatles themselves. Those reviewers who deny the influence of the Beatles are missing the boat. Without them, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc may not have been possible because they would not have been allowed as much artistic control. Buy your copy today and buy it again when it is remastered."
5,"This was my first by Wilson-Harris. I really enjoyed the book, it has a lot to offer a reader: mystery, lies, secrets, love, misunderstandings, and forgiveness. I loved it!"
5,"I loved reading this book. I forced myself not to skip to the end of this book because I wanted to enjoy the ride as long as possible. McBain always teaches you something i.e. strabismusly challenged, INS in Big Bad City (which I already knew) and the subtle variations of the definition of Nocturne (I give Nocturne ***** also). I even went back and read The Black Board Jungle and enjoyed it.Criminal Conversation and Privileged Conversation are also excellent books.McBain/Hunter is an absolute gem. I always feel I've gained an experience from his books."
5,A.J. is the most sweetest guy I ever read about. I hope that everything he said about his fans are true but I was totally heart broken when I found out that he has a girlfriend named Amanda but as long as he's happy so am I.
5,"I ordered these DVDs after my husband had watched most of the series already on TV. He switched to the Blu-Ray discs and was really impressed with the clarity. As usual, Ken Burns has done a wonderful job of telling ""the story behind the story"". I have been to many of the national parks featured, and learned a lot of new information about every one of them. If you like nature, history and beautiful photography, you owe it to yourself to watch this series."
5,"I've set up a couple of these now and they do what they're supposed to. The blue indicator light could be a little less bright, but if it's put behind something, it's not to distracting."
5,"Not to be redundant but The Wire IS the greatest series of all time. It contains some of the best acting, and writing, and directorship you will ever see. It authentically protrays Baltimore streets, way beyond the completely on-point accents. If you tend to shy away from a lot of cursing or violence maybe this show isn't for you. Season by Season there is a different theme each more surprising and intense than the last, it's truly hard to explain everything without giving too much away and way too complex for a plot summary. There are no good guys or bad guys here just human beings trying to make it the best way they can."
5,"Key strokes are perfect not too long and not too short. Though a little louder then say your average run of the mill default keyboard its got a nice sound that lets you know you have hit the key. The build quality is excellent and feels as though i could throw it and it wouldn't break. Though there are only 3 media buttons (sound up/down and mute) thats all any real computer needs. And the back light is perfect. in pitch black conditions its more then bright enough to see every key crystal clear. Even in fully lit conditions the back light is bright enough to make the keys seen. My friend has a G15, which i use all the time, and i prefer this keyboard. Better key feel, smaller more convinient and 1/2 the cost. Its perfect."
5,"Although The Shadow of Solomon is a complex piece of work it is a wonderful collection of a vast array of theory. The author's dedication and detail is impeccable. Yes, he is a conspiracy theorist, but he goes to great lengths to back up his hypotheses.Much of this book surrounds around Secrets from within Freemasonry. Mr. Gardner traces lengths of the organization as well as beliefs back to Solomon, and Ancient Egypt. It reads like a rich text book with bits of the author's fabulous sarcasm scattered throughout. For those interested in the subject this is a wonderful read."
5,"This find was a godsend. My 21 month old finally got some sleep at our lake house and was not unbearable to live with at the end of the weekend. He slept from 7:30p to 8a every night and woke up with out crying. He was finally comfortable sleeping in his Pack and Play. It fit perfectly. The sheet I had bought for the Pack and Play ""mattress"" fit perfectly as well. I would recommend this gem to anyone with a portable crib."
5,"My baby is fussy! However, if I put this Pooh next to him in bed or on his lap when he is in his swing, he goes right to sleep! It is a beautiful toy and the music is so cute. Pooh says NIGHT NIGHT and birds chirp... and I do not think it is too loud like others said."
5,"OMG!! This CD is GREAT! A Song for You is the best song on tha cd...it's my favorite Hathaway song...you can tell he song his heart out on that one...All tha other songs are just as great but A Song for You is my most favorite along with..""BACK TOGETHER AGAIN"", ""GIVING UP"", ""THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU"", ""THE GHETTO"", ""YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND""...simply put...all tha songs on this cd is GREAT..You will NOT fast forward or skip one song cuz it's that GREAT!TWO THUMBS UP!"
5,"Seinfield is the rare bird that appeals to both sexes and has characters who are morally reprehensible in many ways. The 1st and 6th seasons are inconsistent. In the beginning the show was still finding its way and the actors were still trying to define their characters. By the last season the writers seemed to be trying too hard and the humor was over the top. Still every episode has several storylines so some of them are great while others may falter. Kramer sliding and falling is not my favorite part, but that doesn't waste too much time in each episode. The outrageous situations such as the Whale & the golf ball, the fire at the ATM, the Soup Nazi who turns down business showcase what is right about the series. Repeat viewings are still funny and since syndication cuts out parts the dvds are welcome relief."
5,"Cornwell's interpretation of the Arthurian legend is the only one that sticks in my mind. All others (T.H.White, Tennyson, etc.) are now shown up as effete, unfocussed, over-romantic, and as Mediaeval fantasy.The cutting away of the Mediaeval chivalric code, knights in plate armour and maids in tall pointy hats has done the legend a power of good. That stuff was all military propaganda for Edward the First in his invasion and subjugation of Scotland anyway.All the characters are believable and extremely well written, with the possible exception of Arthur himself, who is not given as much colour as one might expect. But then writing about heroes is the most difficult art. It's the backdrop, the construction of Western Britain in the Dark Ages that takes my breath away.I shall be reading this trilogy again and again for many years."
5,"This DDR pad is a great purchase because it's great for beginners. It works perfectly on any type of floor but I would recommend not using it on carpet because it tends to slip a little. I didn't have any trouble dancing the different difficulties but if you're looking for a durable pad, especially if you have a lot of people trying it, you should buy the more expensive ones. When you fold this pad, make sure you don't crease any of the buttons because I did and I had trouble with one of my arrows. It's fine now, I just don't fold it at all. This game is good for those that are 7 and older. I think everyone should try it because TV is the best place to see how much people desperately need DDR.Overall this is a great work out for anyone and it's lots of fun at a great price. It was worth my money!"
5,"as a school project i had to read a science fiction book. I chose Ender's Game. I was expecting it be a pretty boring book but i was so wrong... u should surley read it... i was suprised cause i dont like many books, but i have to say this was one of my favorites -;- -;- -;-"
5,I first heard Taj Mahal in 1972. He's made much music since then. If anyone wants an appreciation for the roots of his talent I recommend this CD
5,i purchased these before and i loved them they work great day and night. i came across these they are cheaper than the ones i purchased before. i bought two and im going to buy another one. A++++
5,"Wow..what a movie! I had no idea what to expect when I saw this DVD. I had heard the reviews but I was hesitant to see a movie with subtitles that seemed to be filled with Kung-Fu images I didn't really know much about. Well, I was mistaken. What a riot and what a great, great story. Part broadway show, part action spoof, part art-house cinematic genius, this movie is great on so many levels. The story itself is a winner and even when the fight sequences go on a tad too long, stick with it because the payback is awesome. You'll howl at the ""axe-gang"" thugs and marvel at the digital and real life stunts that are shown. I actually think the subtitles added to the movie's humor and they were not bothersome at all. The ending was priceless.Watch the gag reel at the end. Bloopers are bloopers in any language."
5,This is my favorite Phish studio album. Great start to finish.Some of my favorite songs are on this album.
5,"My fourth grade teacher read this book to the entire class eleven years ago. I still remember the title and how much I loved listening about a caring woman and her unexpected friend. There wasn't a single student in the class that didn't enjoy this book. If you're looking for a heartwarming tale of friendship with a very original plot, look no further."
5,"Rarely does a work of non-fiction captivate me so! I've been surprised to find myself thinking about our heroines throughout the day, and looking forward to reading a chapter each night. I believe Marshall is a master at her craft.I recommend this book not only to anyone interested in feminism, American history, and Boston, but also to anyone who just enjoys a good read. Call me a nerd, but I say, Ladies, throw down your chick lit, and pick up The Peabody Sisters!"
5,"My husband loves the 505 Straight Fit Jeans. He needs a 38"" x 29"" size and they are very hard to find locally. We buy all of his jeans from this site and have always been very pleased with the product and the customer service."
5,"As Eric Liddell has been my hero since I was a cross country runner in high school, I was glad to finally be able to get my hands on one of his published works. This is a basic guide book for all new disciples of Christ who desire to grow in grace outside of legalism and antinomianism. As my sales coach always preached, ""go back to basics once a year,"" this work has an annual Bible study guide that seasoned saints will prosper from."
5,you'll love this book if you love baseball and wdatch it because it tells you about history and it is exciting.
5,"Wonder Pets, Wonder Pets, We're on our way!:)This show is wonderful for the younger set, with catchy songs, interesting characters, and educational circumstances... with the occasional comment that will have the parents rolling on the floor."
5,"Takes a little while but, I noticed nice gains in muscle size after a few weeks. Gives me a lot more energy and that ""aggressive"" feeling when lifting. I've bought this product several times now."
5,"Pros:- Highly rated by consumer reports- Great suction - cleans well- Lightweight- reat ligth for cleaning under tables or in dark areas/corners- Easy to replace bag- Good filtering- Easy to push/pull to and froCons- Loud (thorugh I think this is directly proportional to the suction capability)Other notes- Regardless of your vacuum, be sure to clean out (long) hairs that get wrapped up in the rollers or your rubber belt with have to work harder and wear out more quickly."
5,"As a teacher, I have read much on the theroy of M.I. Here Armstrong takes the next step by offering specific applications of this theory. I have loaned my book to others and I'm sure I will re-read it again myself. - JVM High School Physics Teacher"
5,"My octogenarian aunt, who grew up in these towns, was delighted to find the lives of her parents and childhood companions described so thoughtfully. This is an important contribution to the history of Colorado and the Rocky Mountain west, and it deserves serious attention."
5,"This is the first MP3 player I bought and I've been very happy with it so far. I use it only at the gym and have had zero problems with it for about the past year. The software that comes with it is simple enough to use. The sound is good and allows different settings, which is handy sometimes. It is also fairly rugged as I have dropped it a few times but it always come back to life. I also like the compact size of it. I recommend it."
5,I K.D TOWNSENDWANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS BOUGHT MY BOOK.I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHY I HAVEN'T WRITTEN A BOOK IN AWHILE.THE GOVERMENT HAS SEIZED MY BOOKS AND HAVE USED THEM AGAINST ME.I HAVENT SINCE THEN FELT THE DESIRE TOO WRITE FOR A LONG TIME.I NOW HAVE BROKEN DOWN MY WALL OF SILENCE. AND HAVE STARTED ON MY NEXT BOOK ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT AND MYSELF.I HOPE WHEN THE BOOK COMES OUT YOU WILL READ IT.IN THE MEAN TIME ENJOY MY OTHER BOOKS.ONCE AGAINTHANK-YOUK.D TOWNSENDAUTHOR
5,"Jack Frost 1 was awesome...it was funny, suspenseful, and just plain silly enough to enjoy. The sequel goes one step farther than that and ups the ante on everything that made the first movie successful. The extremely low budget hinders little and I think this is the movie the director set out to make. The DVD includes a very informative and humorous director's commentary and a few other interesting features. Highly recommended!"
5,I am amazed that people are trashing this film. It is completely obvious that anyone who rates it with one star is just blaming the movie for their own incompetence and frustration. Just because it went way over your head doesn't mean it is a bad film. I will watch this with my children some day and hope that they too can question the nature of humanity as well as all living creatures who inhabit the Earth. I have thought about its message for days and I wish that more people in this country would use their minds instead of acting like brainless meatheads.
5,"This game may have been released in 1996, but it has much better racing and in general, more tracks to choose from than EA's NASCAR series. You can do an entire championship season with the entire 1996 season with the exception of Daytona. The best part of the game is that you can control the opponent strenght up to 120%! I've yet to play a decent simulation/arcade game on the PSX until I got this game."
5,"Elena Kyler will protect her son and keep him away from the man who raped her at all costs. Rico Chavez will kill anyone who stands in the way of getting his son back from the woman he raped, and more than that, he wants the woman, Elena, dead as well. Sean Galen (from the past couple IJ books) has sworn to protect her. He's super tough and Elena's tough too, but Rico is closing in, killing everyone that gets in his way. Five stars for this thriller from Iris Johansen, she gets better with every book she writes."
5,"It's got it all cool tele's and Gretsch guitars,amazing harmonies, Great production and very very good songs and if you listen to the words the key to Eternal life JESUS!!!!!"
5,This was a really awesome book. I didn't like it as much as the first one though. I didn't find Tibby to be very interesting in this book or the last one. Briget was my favorite both times because I never know what is coming next with her. I really did enjoy the book though.
5,"I have been waiting for Ben-Hur on Blu ray for a long time and there have been many various versions ranging from $35 version to ultimate collectors edition for $60. When I saw this for $14, I immediately ordered it (now it is just $10.99 when I wrote the review; I guess I should have waited for another week).Blu ray transfer is excellent. Picture and sound quality could not have been possibly better. They really did a great job with restoring this masterpiece. This movie is a must-have for all fans. It's hard to believe this movie was made in 1959. The final chariot race scene is amazing even in today's standard. Film making at its best.If you don't want to spend $35 or $60, I highly recommend this cheaper edition as you will still get the best out of Blu ray."
5,"I first stumbled upon dead leaves online and decided not to get it because it would mean spending twenty two bucks on an hour long film. I recently viewed it thanks to the magic of Tivo and now I must own it. One hour that will start out interesting, suddenly turn awesome, more awesome, and never stops. Best comparison would be the FLCL, Jet Set Radio, and a dumpster of blood mixed together with a mutant sci-fi theme. Humor in all the worst forms, and at a pace that will keep you laughing till it hurts.Basically the most fun hour I have ever spent in front of a television. Parents may not agree but I think everyone should watch this. It is a blast!"
5,"This book is wonderful! My 3 1/2 year-old son was so enthralled with the vibrant stories and fascinating pictures that he actually cried when I told him that we had read the last story! He asked to sleep with his special Bible.No, the stories are not verbatim scripture, but it is a Bible STORY book -- not a Bible. The stories are told in such a way as to interest young boys and give them a general understanding of what the Bible tells us. I believe that making that connection at a young age will lead to a strong foundation and an interest in reading the Bible as he grows older. As for now we both cherish our special time reading alone together. I just bought the girls' verson for my daughter and can't wait to give her the same wonderful gift."

5,"Stumbled on this book completely by accident. Found it fascinating, educational and very informative. Inspiring, too. I think some computer nerds and related geeks won't find it technical enough. But it's not meant to be technical. Seems like the writer wanted to create a book for a general, intelligent reader. Seems like he succeeded big time."
5,I was just confused by the DVD package that didn't at all relate to the actual movie. Everything else was great though!
5,"A great book, very moving. Ms. O'Reilly's experiences are funny, yet she is able to find meaning in all of it. A life changing book for me."
5,"After the joy of getting 5283 tracks (some 27 minutes long) on my (relatively) new iPod 40GB, I could not resist the green mini iPod for those special occasions and short bicycle trips but mainly because it is a VERY sexy, sleek little lady which is a wonder of modern design and technology. Don't get me wrong. I adore my wife and children and get all human pleasure I need from them but for my passion in music, my collection has received the justice it deserves. On it I have reserved only the very best tracks from the best music - such as John Coltane's CRESCENT, Anita O'Day singing SWEET GEORGIA BROWN, Miles Davis playing MILESTONES, Beethoven, Haydn Trios, etc As grandfather three times over, this little green mini has just added more joy to my autumn."
5,I really Enjoyed reading this book and am also looking forward to reading the other titles I have already uploaded for reading.
5,Six suggestions when using this insightful approach to the bar exam by Dr. Gallagher:1. Listen to her tapes2. Read her book and essays3. Read old exam answers from your jurisdiction4. Use Dr. Gallagher's strategy to answer any subject essay question5. Read her book again and sample essays6. Read her book again and sample essaysYou have now passed the Bar exam!
5,"It's a very positive book, I wouldn't catalog as a religious book, but as a spiritual one. It raises your faith and it's full of methaphysical, spiritual principles. It's one of the best books I've read."
5,Our dog loves it. Easy to fill with any small treat or food. Rolls nicely and dispenses food appropriately. Great buy!
5,"Hmmm... The guy near the bottom is an complete idiot for saying this game sucked... Maybe because he dosent know how to play different game other than lord of the rings (attack and kill... point of game. Thats it.) So dont listen to people like that guys. If youre a smart person, youll be able to actually play a game that isnt only based on one button. You can do what ever you want in this game, you dont HAVE to go on the main quest, really. Do what you want, when you want, how you want- As they say. By the way, im 14. =P"
5,"These were bought to replace my passenger step bar that lost in a fight between my originals and a boulder. They bolt right in, were priced right and have been on a year without showing any blemishes."
5,"John Hassett is my favorite childrens book author. I love his work, and would request it to anyone. If you like this book, also see ""Junior"", ""We got my Broother at the Zoo"", ""Charles of the Wild"", and ""Cat up a Tree"". He is an exellent author, and artist."
5,"I am a pharmacist and I usually don't get a scheduled lunch break, so I must pump whenever I get a free minute. I work 10 hour shifts so I sometimes need to pump twice a day. These wipes work great when in a hurry without access to the sterlizer or dishwasher. I still sterilize the pump every night and morning before I go to work, but they have saved me lots of time during my lunch break so I can actually eat instead of trying to handwash and dry each piece at work."
5,"Imagine the singer and guitar player from the band Interpol playing with the guys in Depeche Mode....THAT is what She Wants Revenge sounds like. If you like either one of those bands, then you're sure to like this band too. It's actually only two guys in the band, but what a great sound they have!"
5,I enjoyed the other pianist's comments of about fellow pianist's. Their detailed descriptions of playing styles are very interesting. Hoffman was great as was many others. This is the type of DVD that I enjoy watching over and over. The violin DVD is also very good.
5,A GREAT BOOK for children of all ages (2 and older)!! Has a great encouraging lesson of selfconfidence and purpose too. The art work is funny and captivating.
5,"There's already a great review by G. Merrit of this book so all I want to do is to add my praise. The poem ""St. Francis and the Sow"" and the commentary by Housden is perhaps the most beautiful, life affirming, soul enriching text I have ever read in my life. To me it is ""sacred text"". I want to send a copy of it to every one I've ever loved, liked, hated or sat across from on a bus!I am new to poetry - I've wanted to be interested in it and I've enjoyed it when it was quoted by others - but I never found it accessible. Housden's commentary has remedied that. But beyond that, Housden's books are more than commentary on poetry. They are the best books on spirituality, life, humanness, God, i.e. the ""important topics"" that I have ever read in my life. Thank you, Roger Housden, for opening this wonderful world to me."
5,Be a fan since the first one. Just had to have it. Are you kidding! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones the best combination ever!!
5,"This is my first fountain pen that i have even owned and i have to say i am very impressed. The pen casing is made of plastic but its very very tough (impossible to bend). The nib is very good quality with and writes smoothly with a constant ink flow. The pen has cartridges for ink refills but you can buy a converter for your own ink. Really the only complaint i have is not about the pen but the ink, it's not waterproof. However this problem can be easily overcome by purchasing some waterproof ink."
5,"Forget the economics slant from other reviewers. In my opinion, this is one of the finest children's books ever written. That it features an interesting, intelligent, fun, individuated girl, moves it to the top of must-have reading.And if you can get it in the original hardcover, with that simple and wonderful illustration, all the better. There's no need for any fancy-schmancy. This is also the perfect gift for an eleven-year old, as the heroine is exactly that age."
5,"Clear and concise instruction on how to learn the game. The exercises at the end of the chapter's are a must for someone whois serious to start taking on opponents.Buy, Read and enjoy it, but most of all learn the basics of thiswonderful game."
5,"I have been using Calvin Klein's Eternity for Men since it appeared back in 1989. I had previously used Calvin and Obsession for Men from CK, but I found a certain distinctive appeal to the clean, fresh scent of Eternity that is never overpowering or intrusive. What I especially like about it is its staying power...many colognes or EDTs lose their ""charm"" later in the day after application. Of course, the aroma of Eternity weakens in strength on the body from its initial spray, but even its mellowed state is recognizable. Fragrance ""layering"" using Eternity's Body Moisturizer and Body Powder adds to the experience. There's something to be said about finding a fragrance that works with one's body chemistry, and I know that Eternity is the one for me. The ""greens, crisp jasmine, sage, and basil"" notes do make a difference, and that is why it continues to be a top CK seller even now in the highly competitive and crowded fragrance market."
5,I have purchased 4 of these after I received one as a gift. So easy to set up and great picture quality. Makes a great gift!
5,"This book has its limits in its origins so it may seem disjointed, but not an impossible read. It is classic science fiction because it gives new points of view and it makes you think. It even tried to explore how feminist ideas might survive the apocalypse and that such a society may not necessarily repeat mistakes of the past.If you are looking for a new book and haven't read this one buy it"
5,i loved this book.i loved the way the generations came together.iloved the story of zefram cochrane.i loved colonel thorsen he's a reallygood bad guy.i lent my copy to a freind who dosen't really like star trek and he loved it.i don't know if i've mentioned this or not but i just loved this book.buy it
5,"I really liked this book. Antigone in particular. Although, it doesnt make sense how the three books by Sophocles were separated and only two are here, still the translators are great and clear."
5,"Anyone who was a New Kid fan will want to get this CD. Even if you're not a Jordan fan, you will WANT THIS CD!! Go get it right now."
5,"Of all the tutorial manuals I have on Photoshop Elements I think this one is the best. While not exactly at a beginner level, it can still be of value to a novice. The great thing is that it pretty much avoids the 'first face the stove' approach that most all books of this nature feel required to do. The lessons on color correction and turning a color photo into black and white are particularly great!"
5,"Well, I AM older!! Mary's book is now the NUMBER ONE book in my decorating library! I have amassed quite a collection of books on the subject of decorting, but not a one is as inspiring as this one. I follow Mary's belief of 'there are no rules when decorating, just things you love'. Her rooms are 'not just another pretty face', but rooms you can live in, while also enjoying the 'scenery'."
5,"All the Gund Goober bears are fun and adorable. Everybody who loves teddies loves Goober, I'm sure."
5,"I saw this group in Barcelona and they have such an amazing energy surrounding them that kept the international crowd interested and hopping as well as infusing their music with influences from hiphop, techno, and jazz! awesome group live and on cd!"
5,The heavyweights the one. Outdoor work or play. Chilly or freezing. The goto hoodie. I've got two. You have to do laundry sometime.
5,"This is the best book ever. Gary Paulsen explains his life and how much he loves dogs, also he tells how many tears and how much laughter they went though. I highly request you read this book, it is great and was always interesting."
5,"Axelrod has done it again! Elizaabeth I, CEO is a must read, especially for those of you, like me, who enjoy a bit of history tossed in with your leadership lessons. It's nice to know that all this leadership stuff has some historical perspective. Axelrod does a super job making history relevant to the present. It's well put together too, and a page-turner. You won't use it to replace your sleep aids."
5,"If you did not experience Katrina as I did, this raw movie reveals the tragedy of the event and the determination to survive.the young actress mezmorises"
5,"I had never heard of this band apart from a crazy friend who loved their early stuff. The latest offering from Eskimo Joe - ""A Song is a City"" is a fantastic album. The songs all contain soft melodic tunes, as well the necessary guitar riffs to make it easy on the ears. They sound similar to Matchbox 20, but with a bit of Radiohead attached.The best songs on the album are: From the City, Older Than You, Car Crash, Smoke and the ultimate awesome song...Wake Up.Eskimo Joe is an emerging alternative band, and I strongly urge you to jump onboard. Big things are ahead..."
5,"Crenshaw's been writing and recording great pop/rock music for so long and has gotten so little press and radio airplay that when you hear the songs on this compilation, if you're hearing them for the first time, you'll feel that you've been let in on this cool secret music club. His songs are kind of a combination of rockabilly, Beatles, soul, and jangle, and every tune on this compilation is over too soon.Even if you already have his CDs or albums, this CD collects his best songs and adds a couple you might not have (Something's Gonna Happen, You're My Favorite Waste of Time). The remastering sounds great, the programming is chronological (though it doesn't really matter because these songs are pretty timeless), and Crenshaw's contributions to the liner notes are fun to read."
5,"The soundtrack to Hope Floats delivers all the emotion of the film, while appealing to a wide variety of audiences. Soundout performances from Garth Brooks and Bryan Adams set the tone, complimented by songs from a variety of newcomers and old timers (No disrespect intended, Mr. Jagger). The wealth of great songs and the blend of different music genres, makes this CD enjoyable for any fan of great music, making it a ""must-have"" item for any CD collection!"
5,"This box set is better than ""So Many Roads"" and the price is well worth it. It is as good as any of the ""Dick's Picks"" also."
5,What a great movie for those that missed it back when. Having visitedIndia recently (a should do for all at some point in life) it had a very special meaning for me. Mandella learned from Ghandi.
5,This CD is classic Johnny and for anyone who loves Johnny Cash and Country Music it is a MUST have!!
5,"As a professional horticulturist gardening in zones 5 through 7, I have searched high and low for a good reference book on tropical and subtropical plants. At last I have found it!Hot Plants for Cool Climates is informative, interesting and well-organized. The design suggestions are new and exciting, and the encyclopedia is stuffed with detailed information regarding cultivation. Particularly helpful were the cultivar names listed under each species (god help me, how did they ever whittle down the list under Coleus?) and the overwintering tips.Serious amateurs and professionals alike will benefit from owning this book."
5,"A Separate Peace has to be one of my favorite novels by far. It is exceptionally written in an easily readable, yet poetic style. It is a novel that will stay with you long after you turn the last page.In the novel Gene Forrester, a student at a boy's prepatory academy in New England, explores the enmity that he believes is present in everyone, except for his best friend Phineas.The novel opens upon Gene's return to Devon, and is told through his reflections over the events that happened while he was at school there during World War II. As he reflects over events that have troubled him over the years, he begins to come to an understanding, and eventually, a peace."
5,Dear Sirs: By my question I do not want you to think that I do not find her death absolutely horrible. I do have one question which was raised by one of the comments. Did she really say yes and where did this person get their information that they indicated she did not. What are the facts. If you can not answer this question would you be so kind as to point me in the right direction. thank you. bna@smart.net
5,I have several different styles of Mechanix Wear gloves but the originals are the best suited for everyday general use and the red looks good too! Stylish and Functional...what more to ask for??
5,"I've been using trackballs for years, my prior trackman was about 5 years old. Finally not sending a good signal. Went to look and it's still being made. Yeah. Bought a new one. Back to happy."
5,"I bought this CD just for the song Black Horse and a Cherry Tree; but found the entire CD to be excellent! I enjoyed it so much and at 62 years old was pleased that my granddaughters - 12 yrs. and 9 yrs. love it, too! It was such a pleasure to find a CD we could all enjoy listening to."
5,"In Step is by far my favorite Stevie Ray Vaughan cd! From the first note of The House is Rockin', we hear Stevie Ray blasting off with what is the best rock blues guitar playing that you will ever hear. Nine hard-driven songs later, Stevie Ray Vaughan plays the beautiful and sublime Riviera Paradise. Next is a short informative speech by Stevie Ray and then come four live tracks, which are my favorites. On In Step Stevie Ray does a very cool job of singing. His strong voice is the perfect compliment to his strong music. Double Trouble provides excellent musical support. In Step was recorded shorthly after Stevie Ray kicked drugs. Maybe it is his new found sobriety that makes In Step sound so fantastic. Whatever the reason(s)for its brilliance, In Step is a masterpiece of rock blues! In Step has my highest positive recommendation.John"
5,Datra Hicks is a person I have been following since she was on Broadway. I love her!! I bought this cd solely for You Make Me Want To Give It Up. I have loved this song since I was in high school and I couldn't find it anywhere! Thank you to the Amazon sellers who have made it available!
5,"The music on this CD is just as wonderful now as it was back in the 70s. Karen's voice is strong, and the mixing of the instruments and backup vocals is skillfully done, just as I remembered it. This CD demonstrates the Carpenters' incredible talent. If you can have only one CD of the Carpenters, this is the one to get. What a shame to have lost Karen so many years ago."
5,"So what a pleasant surprise. This book was an impulse buy for vacation based upon the blend of styles and plot lines offered in the description. I was curious to see if the author could pull it off. And did it ever work.In a nutshell Thursday Next is a Literary Police Officer in England making sure the literary classics maintain their integrity in history. There is magic, comedy, disbelief and fun. The characters are great and most interestingly, in their literary world, quite believable. Those of you that lack a sense of humor or have a literal aura about them probably should move on to some non-fiction, but if you want a well written book that is a fun read, order away."
5,"i had this bootleg in ""99"" before everyone i knew who 50 was i usta listen to strech armstrong 97.1 dj jus to hear new 50 freestylez finally a real mc that dont b.s all over his trackz getz to get his shine.. and even 50 knowz whats up wit yonkers n#ggaz only the real 1nz come from y-o!"
5,"I was lucky to purchase this book about 12 years ago when it was still in publication. It has great reproductions with vivid colors. Repin's paintings look fantastic, among others. It is a quality book with a wide range of styles from various artists of the period. This book truly opened my eye with regards to Russian paintings as if looking through a gate to a rarely seen artistic El Dorado. That said, I can not believe how much some vendors are charging for the book unless it is in such high demand among collectors. If you can afford it, grab a copy."
5,"THIS PRODUCT MAKES YOU WEAK AT THE KNEE'S, NOT SPORTY , NOT LIGHT, NOR TIMID. IT IS < FORMAL YET INTENSE > IT IS NOT FOR THE SHY OR AVERAGE MAN. IT IS QUITE STRONG WITH PASSION, WITH CHAMPAGNE AND MUSIC. VERY MACHO, WOODSY,AND QUITE SEXY. DON'T STAND TOO CLOSE TO ANY OTHER MEN. "" YOU WILL BE THE STAR "" PERFECT FOR THE BEDROOM "" AND LOVEMAKING. ENJOY"
5,The Paraffin wax arrived quickly and in top condition. It makes your hands so soft in such a relaxing way.
5,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He really loves this watch. We recently went on a trip across the country. this watch changed time before we landed. it is water resistant, and pretty tough. for the price i think it was a great buy."
5,"Great set. I won't go into the details about the actual show, but will say the picture quality is fantastic. Lots of bonus stuff, and pretty cheap too.A must buy!"
5,"This is a great anthology of Akkadian literature. It may be one of the best English translations of Akkadian literature of this magnitude. It contains the lost poetry and prose of ancient Assyria and Babylonia. There are over 300 works in this volume, including some of the world's oldest literature. Please note that there are two volumes. The first volume contains introductions to Akkadian literature, language, poetry, and prose. It also contains specific eras such as the Archaic Period (2300-2000 B.C.), the Classical Period (2000-1500 B.C.), and the Mature Period (1500-1000 B.C.). The second volume contains hymns, prayers, and the Akkadian literature of the Late Period (1000-100 B.C.).Another book I would recommend if you like this one is S.N. Kramer's Sumerian Mythology. It is part of the series ""Memoirs of The American Philosophical Society from Independence Square, Philadelphia 1944."
5,"What happens when America forgets her ideals and operates on fear, greed, and bigotry? In 1942, 120,000 Americans were put into prison camps just because the ""looked like"" the enemy. Joanne Oppenheim's fascinating account of the incarceration uses a unique perspective to give relevance to this stain on American history: the letters of the children who lived it.It turns out that Clara Breed, the children's librarian of San Diego, had entered into a correspondence with her young, incarcerated patrons and those letters are at the heart of this amazing read. The letters and books she sent to the children (and their informative responses) are at the heart of this documentary history, along with articles, photographs, cartoons, oral histories, and a wealth of other primary materials lovingly integrated by the author.Beyond a mere ""history"", the book is the story of how one person can make a difference - to history and to the lives of others."
5,"The book may not be long but it is amazing non the less. i definitly recomend this book weather your a cutter or not, it was amazingly written as well. 5 stars for sure!"
5,"This book gives a great overview of the philosophical underpinnings of modern thought, as told from the perspective from a Neo-Thomist. Gilson is a master of his trade, as evinced by the fact that the book is very readable (at least for students of Philosophy!). In my lowly opinion, this is a definitive work that should be on every serious philosophy student's shelf, and it is a shame that no one is reprinting it at this time, so grab up all the available copies while you can!"
5,"My fiance' loves this frying pan. I visited him on leave and i wanted to threw all his worthless crap out when I was cooking dinner one night. When I return to from leave, I ordered him this pan and he is in love with it!! Thanks"
5,"I've been a face to face fan for five years, and this cd just won't lose its edge...just as good as the day i bought it! if you like emo-core, its a great break from the snotty/poppy punk trend. check them live...loud, fast, sharp!"
5,"This is an excellent book written with great clarity by a non-expert. Although the author only deals with the political aspects of the Norman conquest of the region, he writes in such a way as to make the major characters of this period come alive. He ignores the social and cultural aspects (which are fascinating of themselves), but in his own area he is outstanding as he explains the shifting politics of the region. He argues that the Norman superiority on the battlefield was not just due to their mounted charge but the oft ignored fact that they exhibited great discipline on the battlefield with the ability to make difficult tactical shifts of bodies of knights.The book has very good footnotes, an excellent bibliography, and maps that can even be read on the kindle."
5,This contact paper is high quality and matched other furniture I have perfectly!It was easily installed. I would not hesitate ordering from this source again.
5,"what a great book -- addictively interesting, funny, and nostalgic. Many of them brought back childhood memories of the story about the guy who.....; others I'd heard told to me as fact; others were new to me. All were interesting -- highly recommended."
5,A girl in my son's college class had these and he came home and HAD to have them! I came right online and purchased two packages for him. He's in heaven! He loves them. They are a little pricey but they go a long way and sometimes you just gotta have something when you want it.
5,"This border is adorable and so easy to apply. I love it! I know it was listed in the baby nursery section...but I put it in my kitchen as I am a bunny collector. It really brightened my kitchen up a bit. And the price was so cheap that I was afraid it was cheaply made, but it is top quality. I am so happy with this purchase!!!"
5,"I read this book becasue my friend told me I should. She said I would cry, and I did. Ryan White was a remarkable person. He was born with hemophilia and struggled through much of his short life trying to be a normal kid. Ryan was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. I am 14 years old, and I know what it is like to be a teenager. The trials and tribulations any normal teen goes through, Ryan went through but he did it with his deadly disease. I am amazed at how much strength and courage he and his family all had. When their own hometown turned their backs on the White family, they moved and built up a whole new life with new friends. Wherever Ryan went, his message also followed and the message is this: NEVER give up on your life. Thank you."
5,"I bought this wireless smoke detector and another that replaces one of my hard-wired detectors. When this detector goes off, it sends a signal to the hard-wired detector which sets off all the smoke detectors in the house. Great idea and works as advertised."
5,"Justin Mcroberts is the most under appreciated artist i know of and i only came across one of his cds by chance! This album is beautiful. It is driven mainly in an acoustic style yet has sparks of electric shining through on several songs. Justin mcroberts has been truely gifted, his passion and soul burst through in every song on an album that does not appear to have been written just for the sake of making music but as a living testimony. The album (as the title suggests) searches such issues as trust, relationships, leadership, lonliness, friendship and even steps out eerily into touching on issues raised by pornography.Although Justin Mcroberts is a christian, and some of the lyrics reflect this strongly, i really do believe that non-christians will also love this album for so many reasons.The bottom line is that you should not just buy this cd, but you should buy all his other albums too. You won't regret it!"
5,"This book is remarkable for what it has - high class writing that is totally down and dirty, yet it's full of passion and emotion and lust and craving. Some of the less dirty stories are very powerful, with nothing more than the truth of submission to them. Great book, highly recommended."
5,This my first digital camara and I looked around and questioned others about their camara. This camara seemed to have what I wanted and I am very satisfied with it. In fact after using mine my boyfriend also bought one.
5,"The pockets are large enough to hold a standard 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper, woo-hoo! So my son's treasures will not be wrinkled. In addition to fill-in-the-blanks that help you and your child remember details such as favorite color, teacher's name, height, etc, each grade has a place for your child's school picture, a place for his signature, and storage for paper keepsakes. I love it. The only improvement they could make is maybe making the book expandable to hold more keepsakes. Sometimes it's hard to choose just a few!"
5,"Making this choice was not easy for me. After months of listening and cranking up systems at various stores (yes, that's me trying to blow the speakers, I love it when the salesmen comes over and is trying to say something but you can't hear him. I like to give them that Blueman Group stare),I found what I was looking for. A sexy looking system, crisp sound, room thundering lows and easy on the pocket. While I was considering a Bose system the price kept turning me off--sounds great, price sucks. The HKTS-18 offers a great sounding system at a realistic price. Thanks to Bose's pricing, it kept me in the game a little longer. Long enough to find this gem from Harman Kardon. Very satisfied. Plus shipping from Amazon was amazing. Received the speakers in two days on standard shipping. Nice surprise."
5,"This is a classy little book to put on your coffee table. It is simply the constitution and Declaration of Independence. If you are a patriot, and want to refer to it often, keep it out."
5,"this is one you might have to see. Jim Gaffigan is a surveyist(however you spell it). he takes ordinary topics from food packaging to waiters, and tells how it is. im a simple man. i dont enjoy much comedy nowadays do to the fact that most comedians are nasty and perverted. he is as clean as a fresh towel falling on the floor. most of his material relates to what people are thinking. all in all, a funny white guy for the good in me"
5,"very pleased with prompt service and cologne was received as listed and with no problems. excellent price, prompt service all positives."
5,"I purchased this item seven months ago and I remain convinced that this is probably the best item that I have ever purchased from Amazon (I'm a regular customer). It is accurate and reliable with excellent sound quality. I find the settings easy to use and the screen easy to read. After many years of searching, I have found a clock radio that provides me with both pleasure and dependability."
5,"Dr. Gerritsen is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors whose books consistently keeps me up late at night! A fast read that's hard to put down, THE SURGEON thrills even during the in-between parts. It's also a disturbing book that deals with various aspects of rape. Sure, we cheer for Catherine who has found the inner strength to not let the trauma of rape take over her life. Yet you can't help but feel for those who, years later, are still haunted by their ordeal. In our PC/New Age society, it's a relief to read an honest account that isn't afraid to call a victim a victim.Definitely one of the best thrillers of 2001!"
5,"Not only will this book help you pass the CISA Exam, but you will gain a true insight on what is expected of a true practitioner. In combination with the instructor led calsses offered by CertTest, the preperation for the CISA exam was incredibly thorough. Book is well written and very relevant."
5,"After 2 years these are still serving me well as headphones for my computer laptop. The pads are good as new; the sound is still clear and deep. I really like having the volume control on the cord, so I don't have to fiddle with the computer to change the sound level. They are light on the head and I wear them for hours without noticing that they are there. They are light, so if you are hard (!) on your headphones, then maybe you might want something more substantial. Sometimes the sounds of the headphones depend a lot on the program they are used on. Some applications require audio enhancers, some merely require setting up the equalizer to where you like it. With a decent frequency range and fairly sturdy speakers, for the average listener, and for the money, these can't be beat."
5,"I almost didn't buy this product because it was so much more expensive than some of the others, but I'm glad I did. When I received it, I realized that this is an advent calendar that will be in our family for generations. It is high quality, good craftsmanship. The little figures are wooden with magnets on the back that 'stick' to the metal manger scene. Each figure is painted in detail, and this year my daughter had a wonderful time examining each of them as I told her their role in the Christmas story. This is a wonderful product to add to your family Christmas traditions."
5,Mechanically relentless. Surprisingly danceable. Buy it and get back to work.
5,"The school text books never do justice to the incredible journeys of Columbus. Admiral Morison's writing is crisp, incisive and often subtly humorous. His special insights into the navigation challenges will particularly entertain sailors."
5,"I bought the Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000 from Amazon in December, 2007 and I've had it at my desk since. The ergonomics are very well designed for my hands, the typing is quiet and the keys well cushioned. 3 1/2 years later and I'm only now considering replacing it, and that's based solely on some of the paint coming up and that I don't feel like giving it a good cleaning. I have never had a problem with the board itself or the software. The mechanics of the keyboard are still very solid. I have definitely gotten my money's worth and strongly suggest this to anybody looking for a new ergonomic keyboard."
5,This book has been a favorite for twenty-five years. It's been around a long time but it's message is still relavent to out times.
5,"I cannot think about Sandra's books without having a smile on my face. And when I read them, which I have done loads of times I am in stitches. Eirik and Eadyth are another of Sandra's perfectly matched couples. They will have in tears of laughter with their antics. Especially when you read about Eirik standing on his head.Thank you Sandra for giving us another marvelous story in your Viking series. I love them all."
5,"My four year old son goes back to this game over and over again. It's a fun and engaging game that can be played in a number of different ways, even, as we play it, non-competitively. And we love playing it with him. It's a fun for all ages game."
5,"Although I am an experienced user, I have learned a lot from this book. It is very thorough and detailed yet easy and even fun to read. Thanks to McClelland's co-operation with Adobe, it contains inside information that I never spotted anywhere else (this is the 5th Photoshop book I've read), but also constructive criticism towards the Photoshop team.My only complaint is that some of his examples are (although very extensive) not very practical: I learned the effects of the Exclusion blending mode, but no useful purposes.But still - along with the very specialised 'Photoshop Channel Chops' - this is the best Photoshop book I know of."
5,"This is an excellent book, combined with the usual magic Star Wars always contains. Michael stackpole is an superb author.The other 8 are also good."
5,"Simply one of the best books I've ever read. Matthiessen manages to capture the length and breadth of his journey in every sense of those words. A book this helpful on the spiritual aspects of the journey would be excellent; a book this fascinating about a trek like his would be great; put 'em together and you win a national book award. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to think, learn, and grow. If you want simple entertainment enter John Grisham in the search box."
5,"it was a nice present for my family, they liked so much the music, smooth listening and a perfect gift"
5,"Sometimes watch 7 shows in a night. Quick witted, brilliantly written, fun, intuitive, complex and still relevant to today! Love it!"
5,It is nice because it allows multiple players. It has different levels. It allows the players to interact with each other.
5,"we gave this book 5 star's because it is a good book to read. It is very exciting, funny, and sad at times and once you start to read it you just want to keep on going and you can't stop."
5,"> I have never felt better in my life, since that day that I was> searching the aisles in the library and stumbled onto this book. I> have been to a dietician, doctors and so on you know the story. But> I have been following your program and now I feel great."
5,"I bought this for my mother and she loves it. Unlike most reviews, hers works fine and she has no complaints."
5,"I've had my one of these for over 18 months now and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.No crashes, no corruptions all data saved and recovered just fine.Thumbs up as is it cheaper than Sony but officialy licensed."
5,This product works great. I would recommend this to anyone with a d4160 HP printer that would like to print things.
5,"You might say that im a little too old for this book, but hey age is just a number. My obession with this Opus began in 1995 when my little sister brought home to me ""Good night Opus"" Before that i had a couple stuffed character Opus. She didn't care for the book but she knew I liked him. It is a real good book to read when you are down or just want to depart from the text. I love Opus and it was a real shame to see Berkley Breathed go so soon. I'll miss his style"
5,"This is BEST total workout ever. I've tried Power90, Beach body, Tae-Bo....but there is something about this workout that beats the other programs hands down...It's so addictive in positive way. I love what it has done to for my body. I was in good shape before...But now, in great shape! What I like most is that you get a total body workout...every muscle in your body in the shortest amount of time. A plus for busy lives! This is a must buy...You will absolutely love the program!!! Any workout programs that Commander Tom produces, you should definitely purchase...you will be so glad you did!Commander Tom is the BEST!!!"
5,"I think this is a great movie to teach young kids about selfishness. My daughter can easily watch this movie about 3 times in a row! As an adult, my heart has been convicted while watching this movie!"
5,The movie is excellent and makes me miss Dudley Moore all the more. The interaction between all actors always makes me laugh and it really entertained me. I love the sparring with Liza and Dudley.
5,I was fortunate to see Marillion play this album live at Massey Hall in Toronto. The album has no stops between songs so is like one huge song which is different for an album. I ran out and bought the album the next day and the album was like a drug for my whole first year in University. I played it every night and probably would have slit my wrists without it(slight exaggeration but you get the point). Fish weaves such a spell live it is incredible and although I've seen many concerts that night singing songs with Marillion and a sold out crowd is one I will never forget. I'll always remember Fish taking a break after a song and while sitting on a drum riser telling us all a hilarious joke. Buy this album it is one for people who appreciate musical genius and poetry in their music.
5,"What an amazing concert on DVD! I've had this DVD for well over 3 years now and I tell you, this has got to be one of the most visually satisfying concerts ever recorded on DVD. Incredible camera work, incredible editing, and that's not even to mention the rocking set list from this concert. Truly an incredible buy. A must for any Dream Theater fan."
5,"A most beautiful book. A gift from all children to their parents, and to our children. A must read for all. From the sadness, we are re-borne, knowing we must survive. That this may never happen, ever again. We see not only the Jewish sorrow of the Holocaust, but also the damage done to Germans, and the world. We may not have made the journey in the same ship, but we are in the same boat. God bless you Edith and Fern."
5,"I received this trimmer about 1 month ago and I am impressed. Although it is a tad bit heavier than I would like, it certainly works quite awhile before running out of juice, like some of it's competitors. Plus, it gets though heavier stuff than I would have imagined. The string feed works great! The wall bracket/charger is nice.I have had a couple wired trimmers and gas trimmers over the years. I believe this is my favorite. I do wish it had a strap, but thats not a major issue.It is so nice to trim without smelling like 2-cycle oil or having to drag out drop cords. Great value here."
5,"I love cordless tools; this is the 15th cordless tool that I bought and it is really handy when it comes the time to trim a little edge off or drill a hole for a hinge. I am not a carpenter or any expert when it comes to woodworking, but I believe there is a purpose for each tool, and this router, after owning for just 1 week, helped me installed a pet door out of the wall on the sunroom. It chewed up the plywood fast and easy, saved me from chiseling. Good tool! Wish I had it when I installed my new door lock..."
5,"This book is the book that got me back into reading. I have to admit that this book kept me up reading until midnight some nights this summer. Despite it being 425 pages, it keeps you interested and wondering what is going to happen next. This book is a good long book to read on the boring and lagging summer days. Since I broke my arm this summer, this book is the was the only boredom breaker I had. I plan to read book 1 and 2 this summer because of this book."
5,"I had to read Mary and Matilda for class but I really enjoyed both stories. I didn't have time to read Maria, so I cannot comment on them. It's not a hard read and it's really easy to understand. Mary is semi-hard to follow because she uses ""she"" and ""he"" a lot even though she talks about two ""shes"" at the same time, so it's slightly confusing. I loved the book regardless."
5,"God's Property and Kirk Franklin, do so well with the songs. They are touching, and will stick with you all day. I absolutely loved it!"
5,This is a CD of nostalgic Christmas songs from the 1940s and 1950s. Each of the songs are sung by the artist who made it famous. It's wonderful hearing the tunes of your youth.
5,This thermometer has saved many chicken dinners from being ruined. It works for baked goods as well. I can't live without it!
5,I just can't get enough of this CD! Connie's voice and extremely sensitive emotional interp retation brings to mind a divine combination of Streisand and Jane Oliver.The collection of material is a mix of old Broadway standards and wonderful original material. In particular the track 'Shadows and Air' (Written by Pachl and her artistic collaborator Michael Brill) combines an unforgetable melody and message with lush orchestrations. The net result is a truely inspirational piece of music that gives me chills every time I hear it. Then there's 'The Little Goat Herd' from 'The Sound of Music' swooping in to provide some comic relief while still allowing Connie to dazzle us with her remarkable voice.I WANT MORE CONNIE!
5,"I purchased the Lowepro Slingshot 200 All weather backpack just before I left for my vacation to New York and it was one of the best decisions I made. We covered a lot of ground and walked to most of our desinations. I have the Nikkon D-60 with two lenses and this backpack was perfect. Light weight, easy access, and plenty of space.Cons: There is no pocket for a bottle water. Keep in mind that there is enough room for the camara and accessories only, and not much for anything else."
5,Both collections 1 and 2 are fun filled evenings. Invite a few friends over and have a Moto party. MUCH better than a super bowl party - Moto is entertaining and even a bit cheesy-campy - not hormonal on screen or off.
5,"I love this book! It is well written and fun to read. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the piano. The author not only gives ""how to"" instruction for learning to play the piano, he also educates the reader on the history and care of your instrument of choice. The book has the feel of having a friend help you make informed decisions about your piano purchase. This book could be especially helpful to parents of a budding musician who will be buying his first piano. The book is also helpful for those who want to learn to play. The first songs are simple with step by step instruction and make learning fun. This is an excellent book."
5,Time will tell but this is the best one I've bought in a long time. A tad on the heavy side but it seems to be built to last. I can work with both speeds. The low speed is pretty quiet which is good when the wife is sleeping in.
5,"From 1989.Tracks:1) Right Between the Eyes2) Two For the Road3) Taking My Breath Away4) A Far Cry5) In Your Eyes6) Holy Man's War7) Bad Times8) Double Life9) Forever Young10) Running Under Fire11) Peace & LoveProduced by Dan Wexler.Alice Cooper does guest vocals on ""Two for the Road"""
5,"Martha Kate knows how to go to the heart of the matter. As we travel through this life, this delightful meanderings of her thoughts brings one back to the reality that ""grace"" is a free gift taken for granted by we Christians. She inspires us to reflect on our journey in life and the grace bestowed on us by God at various stops in our lives. This book was a short read but one I intend to read over and over and reflect on the thoughts and insights shared. I too have been prayed over for ""travelling grace"" and know the awesome power of that prayer."
5,"Does exactly what the directions say it will do. I'v hardly used any since purchasing and already see the results. Although I only use it on my legs, which for some reason don't tan as easily as the rest, I will never go back to the tanning booth again. Saving a ton of money each month. Worth the purchase for sure!"
5,VERY OUTSTANDING BOOK TO GROW SPIRITUALY WITH ENJOYING IT TO THE UPMOST. WILL BE HELPFUL IN TIME TO COME IN MY CHURCH. I BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF AND I'M ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH GREAT BOOK AND SELLER. THANKS
5,"I've only had this bag for two months and so far I can say Im very happy with it. As an electrician for twenty years, I wish I would have found this item sooner. After years of using cheap bags that offer minimal tool organization, this bag is excellent if you appreciate being able to find the tool you need without having to rummage through everything to find it, I also enjoy the fact that with a quick lookover, I know if I have all of my tools before leaving a project. The XL might be slightly larger than I would've needed, but the added space does come in handy. Even with all of my hand tools in place, there is room to toss in a drill, heat gun, etc. on top. The overall construction seems to be very durable. The bag is heavy, but I think its worth the price for something that works very well."
5,I have been listening to FS for a long time and still this is the only album of his I have. Its an extraordinary statement to claim Only The Lonely a perfect piece of art but thats my feeling - judging by other reviews I'm not alone - Ive discarded the last two tracks from my ipod since they are obviously from another plan - and just whats the problem with the art work folks?! If you havent heard the album get it NOW!
5,Hornby's terrific in describing the thoughts and painof those of us who can never seem to figure it out. I lookforward to his next book.
5,When I first saw this movie on TBS I was laughing hysterically but knew I was missing something. So the next day I bought the unedited version and it was even funnier than before. Its too bad the sequels stunk though they would have been good with Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty.
5,"Who'd think that a game about killing bunnies in strange ways would be entertaining? Well, someone did because there's this game. And we are so glad there is! We are not a big card or board game family, but this is one game that my entire family will sit down and play for hours on end. The point of the game is to collect the most carrots and bunnies while killing off your opponents. It's hilarious. There are a bunch of expansion packs you can buy that go with the starter game, making the fun last even longer."
5,"In order to write about fairy takes an author needs to a great imagination, Kelly McClymer has that ability to imagine a place and people and making it very real. Excellent book"
5,Every time I pick up this book I deepen my understanding of the exegetical issues regarding the translation of Hebrew and Greek into English. This is not a book that can be absorbed all in one reading. I particularly like how the author exposes the faulty reasoning of critics and presents very complex and technical arguments in such a manner that even those who do not have formal training in the original languages of the bible can understand. This book is in some ways almost an intermeadiate Greek grammar of sorts. Outstanding !I highly recommend it.
5,"to reveal the story of your life and I think Trena Cole did a good job revealing hers. It had to be as hard to write this book as it was to read it. I like her style and guts. She was brutally honest about the cruel emotional abuse she and her brothers and sisters lived through. This isn't a book for the faint of heart, it's sad the way those kids were treated, but it does give the reader a lot of insight to the way some kids live every day. This woman is a true survivor of berating brainwashing in the worst way and I admire her for telling on the creeps who lorded over her while she was young. The book was a little choppy in spots and repetitive in others, but all and all I'm glad I read it. I would recommend it because I think it's important to expose how neglect and abuse make children feel, not only while they are being neglected and abused but forever."
5,John Hare is one of the most brilliant ethicists of his generation. His most recent series on ethics and the trinity should prove to be the most influential text on ethics since Kant. Kudos to the Englishman!
5,"What makes the JAWS franchise such a rarity in Hollywood is that each installment has managed to be better than the one that immediately preceded it. JAWS THE REVENGE is no exception. This chapter picks up the story of Sheriff Brody's widow, (played once again by the marvelous Lorraine Gary), who finds herself the intended victim of a vengeful shark who'll stop at nothing to even the score with the comely lass, even following her plane from smalltown Amity to the beaches of the Bahamas. The result is a contemporary shocker with more chills than the first three JAWS put together. Academy Award Winner Michael Caine has never been better."
5,"Just got my new bag today - fast shipping, came in good condition. I was surprised and pleased that the bag is roomy enough for me to insert a little extra padding of my own if I want it for my smaller guitar, yet has ample room for my larger guitar. The straps are great for carrying - easy on my back... Highly recommend this gig bag."
5,"Yogi Tea's masterpiece, African Redbush Tea, was recommended to me by a friend. I went to Yogi's website to request a free sample of this delicious tea, and then I waited six weeks for it to arrive. The bold, earthy taste of this tea calms me every time I drink it. It does not contain added caffeine, and the flavors are all natural, including Ginger Root, Cardamom Seed, and peach. This tea is light and I enjoy it every evening, as it is strong-flavored but not too heavy. I highly recommend this tea to everyone, as I have to family and friends already."
5,"This is the second copy that I have ordered because I gave mine away as a gift. I love this cookbook, and although there is not any color photos the author does a good job of explaining. I would tell anyone who is a food lover to get this book. It is full of wonderfull recipes,as well as indepth history of origin."
5,"I haven't done a close analysis of multiple translations, but having cursorily read various parts from some translations and wholly loving Machiavelli's writings for the insights they yield about Renaissance Florence and today, I can only add to previous comments by commending the Robert Adams translation. It is not at all dry, the most humorous one I've encountered, with the wit (read: sarcasm) shining through. An Adams translation of The Discourses does not exist, unfortunately."
5,"Dixie Chicks' singer Natalie Maines' notorious cut at the president is amedia story that just won't leave us, will it? However, mainstream mediahas only scratched the surface of what it means to the American public.Don't expect to find the same redundant Fox News and CNN sound bites andslogans in this film. Instead, you'll want to brace yourself for sometruly unique American discourse within this odyssey into the dark side ofpatriotism. It's heavy metal parking lot meets the sophistication of ErrolMorris or Spike Lee. This film is a historical time capsule and I watchedit as if I had my eyes pressed against a fishbowl of quirky Americanculture. I'm not particularly a Dixie Chicks music fan; I love this filmfor the sociopolitical issues and its stark moments of human nature,though I can see how this profound and ongoing dialog is stronglyappealing to Dixie Chicks fans and anti-fans alike."
5,"A well written book. Based on the architectural images provided in the book, it provides the reader a clear perception of architectural space and its environs. Although I have practiced architecture in the United States for over 28 years, I have been reminded again of what makes Philippine architecture unique. Architect Francisco Manosa captured the essence of indigenous tropical malay architecture and the only missing elements are the aromas coming from the kitchen and you feel you have actually lived in these houses. Congratulations on a well documented project and I wish Mr. Caruncho all the encouragement to continue writing on projects such as this."
5,"A book to be cherished, a book that is making me a better person. I am conciously delaying it to enjoy it for as long as possible..! Morrie is a true mentor and this is the kind of book I would have like to have written myself, it speaks a human language, it is my feeling and approach to life written down in words that make sense. It's written like it is to be loved, like life is to be lived, to its full intensity. I plan to give this book to everyone I know and respect."
5,"Classic Redman, nothin but that p funk rap style from '92. If you like Redman, no doubt you'll love this. Jam 4 Life."
5,"I was 10 when I first seen ""Buster and Billie"". I just bought the movie on ""DVD"" 2005, The quality is not so great, but that is ok for me because this is a hard to find ""DVD"". If you seen this movie years ago or never seen it before, I think you will like this movie. This movie is a 5 star all the way."
5,"This book is extremely valuable, specially for new film makers that are just learning the ropes. The book has tons of practical and useful information that very rarely would be learned at school, unless, of course, they ask you to read this book."
5,"Although the Tatgus TLE400 notebook case is a bit on the expensive side, this Deluxe Leather case is well worth the extra expense. It is roomy with plenty of pockets for periferals, cords, USB drive, Power adapter or whatever. Plus a side pocket for your paperwork that will hold legal size folders and an end pocket for your cell phone. The leather is suptle and the comfortable, padded shoulder strap is angled to help stay in place. Downside, it is a bit heavy when fully loaded and the zippers are a bit stiff to use. Also it could use extra padding strips for the notebook compartment. But if you have a 17 inch notebook, this is the case for it; the only case I found that actually fits my Acer 17 inch perfectly. Or, even if you have a 15 inch notebook but need to carry legal size folders this would be the case to have."
5,I use this product as a power supply for my Danelectro CoolCat Transparent Overdrive. It is great because it reduce any noise from network...And the most important: it have a small price!
5,"this album flat out is an amazing venture for howie day, as he takes his listeners on a journey through beautifully orchestrated songs. this singer/songwriter isnt the typical ""strumming guitars/mellow music"" kind of guy, as mr. day has an incredible attention to melody, sounds dynamics, and his particular audience. his music isn't easy to describe, but i strongly recommend this album to anyone interested in a unique singer/songwriter."
5,"my 2 year old loves these animals. the aligators are his favorite. Not much to say, except they're very durable and fun. Nice addition to the zoo or ark."
5,"This book is great. It has recipes for virtually anything you might want to make, and many of them are very simple. I use this book all the time. I have dozens of cookbooks and this is one that I get a lot of use out of. I do love cookbooks with photos, which this one does not have, but it gets more mileage than any of my others."
5,"I have two, long-haired cats who shed profusely most of the year. I hesitated because of the expense, but bought my first Furminator in the hope that if it did half of what the manufacturer claimed, it would be worth the price. An 80% reduction in shedding for these two cats would be miraculous! WOW! This product far exceeded my expectations, lived up to its name and drastically reduced the shedding.I bought this larger Furminator for my daughter - although her dog is a short haired, Golden Retriever his shedding was the same or worse than my cats. Needless to say, Furminator saved the day - and the constant need to vacuum, remove hair from the furniture, etc. The best part is that it's easy to use and the animals love it! I highly recommend this product."
5,I love this type of movie! Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. What happened to making movies with castles and class? Great Buy!
5,"So much has been written about Harry that I'm not even going to try. This set, however, is another matter. It's great to have the first five books all in one box, lined up on the shelf, all one size, and in complementary colors. THey're bound well, and the illustrations are terrific."
5,"My son loved this costume for Halloween! The sizing was accurate and the fake muscles were great! This costume ""super""! :)"
5,this was a great book on derek jeters accomplishments dreams and just everything you will need and want to know about derek jeter> i really like the quote that is used i think by his parents: you can't change what happenes:) so if you like derek jeter you will love this book
5,I am very happy with this DVD player. It's performing well and doing what I expected of this product.
5,"Get You Some of Me came as a huge suprise. I hadn't heard anything out of the band since Tiger Town, their 5th record. I knew the band had been through a line-up change, but since I moved out of Louisiana, I hadn't been able to keep close tabs on their status.Get You Some of Me is most reminiscent of Dash's second album, Ace of Clubs, in that it features a variety types of music, all quintessentially DASHesq. There are a few songs with goofily ill-advised lyrics, but overall Get You Some of Me has become the record I go to first when I'm jones'n for some DASH. Where else can you get punk, country, blues, ragtime piano, and disco all in one package."
5,"I have seen this film several times and never tire of it. Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones have great chemistry, which develops while she (a seductive insurance investigator) attempts to entrap Connery, a master thief. Instead the two join forces for a hair-raising, multibillion dollar heist at the new millenium."
5,This is a surprising movie...the emotions you feel in this is surprising...after watching this for the first time several years ago I knew I had to have this --- so will anyone who sees this movie..a must have!
5,"Exactly what I needed for some of my necklaces that are just a bit too short. Very well made, lovely packaging, quick shipment."
5,"Federico Garcia Lorca is perhaps the most important Spanish poet of the twentieth century. No less than seven of his works are included in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" published by America Reads Spanish, a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US. Antologia Poetica is a ""classic"" as quoted in the guide."
5,"This is a great book. It had both humor and intrigue, with a touch of romance. It was easy to read and kept my interest. I was surprised by the ending. I would read more of Stephanie Bond"
5,"The gangs are ! Anybody know that ! But when a true story recount as a professor who has only his job in his life to survive while he is embarked in a bad almost murder to himself, and when after that, he is bound to appropriate the bad instinct of the bads gangsters for make to them the same thing who has lived some years ago, he take his courage and go heretofore at the extremity of the human gender, with no limits ! This is a true MOVIE with a forceful man as SAMUEL L. JACKSON SPLENDID WHEN THE YOUNG MAN CHICANOS HAS HIS FINGER CUT !!!"
5,"I am buying my fourth copy of this CD and two others of Pandolfi's: my mother-in-law wants them for her new Bose CD player and my two COLLEGE students want them for the dorm! Obviously, our whole family loves all of Pandolfi's music. They know he is my favorite pianist and the teenagers often put his CDs on to keep me calm! The beauty and clarity of his playing is so soothing. You can imagine my delight and surprise when the 18 and 20 year olds asked for his CDs for Christmas!"
5,"This is a great book for pulling together a Family Home Evening quickly and effectively for BUSY families. The lessons can also be adapted for older children, so don't have the impression that it is only for families with very young children. Very helpful book!"
5,"THis book is a great resource for anyone who wants to keep their animals healthy. Prevention is the best medicine, and this gives all the best prevention tips you could need. Your cattle, horses, sheep, goats, poultry and sheep dogs will thank you for purchasing this book.This book has already paid for it'sself on my farm"
5,The buttons on this remote are spaced nicely which allows you to feel them easily. This keeps you from looking down and taking your eyes off of the road (main reason I bought it). The buttons also glow in the dark. The size is perfect. Fits the hand nicely. No lag noticed when using for my roady2 receiver.The package states it comes with a battery(although amazon did not). Amazon is right. You need a CR2032 battery. This is the same size found in most garage door opener remotes.It is ridiculously low priced! You could get a few spares for what it costs! The batteries cost as much as the remote. Probably why they aren't included for this price.
5,"I really enjoyed the WEB of LOVE, as I do with all of Mary Balogh's books. I read all of them over and over."
5,"Love the movie, music, and the thought inspiration. True that the bloodlines really do matter in breeding quality. Not just horses but other mamals as well."
5,"I love it . It works great, you can leave the saw on it and roll it around, load it on a truck, whatever. Just right."
5,"I find the Palm IIIc absolutely wonderful! It is stunning to view, and with the 8MB of memory I have plenty of room to write down/enter everything I might need. I am in the medical field and I use it for entering lab results, making treatment notes, jotting down phone numbers etc. It makes my lab coat pocket much less crowded than dozens of notes on tiny bits of paper! The color allows me to divide notes more easily - patients, professional, personal etc. I carry it everywhere and highly recommend it."
5,"Capatilism 2 allows you do do a lot of the stuff. It's competion can be extreamly high. Unlike most sim games, you get to do research and it acsually makes you fell as if it were real. I'd buy this game even if it were $100!"
5,"I got this frame because my step-daughter requested it for our second grandbaby. I had purchased one for our first grandbaby and she fell in love with it, so when she became pregnant with the second one she ask that I please find this frame for him also. I did and she is extremely happy about it."
5,It does exactly what it is expected to do. Very satisfied with how this product has worked for me and recommend it.
5,"This was a Christmas present for my 2.8 year old and was a big hit. He really loves music and my husband is a good piano player so it is a good start to learn his first steps into piano. I really like that is a traditional little piano, not complicated, not electric, just what a little kid needs, and I also think this is a really good brand for wooden toys."
5,This dear book about three homeless little dogs is clever and original. I agree that this is Gag's best book and I am delighted that another generation of children will get to know it. This new beautiful oversized edition is even more wonderful than the old(loved to tatters)one I already own. I have bought a copy for my little grandson and another one for my own collection.
5,"Awesome CD! I bought it for ""Why you been gone so long?"" but I love the other tracks. I saw 1100 in concert in Plano TX and they blew the other bands away."
5,"Rage's first album is by far their best. Tracks 1,2,3,5, and 9 are some of the best songs I've ever heard. If you have one of the other Rage albums and like it, then you should definitely buy this one."
5,I have used this mirror for one season. When placed on my windshield it stays in place. Make your adjustments before you adhere it to your windshield. I use it on my Bowrider center winshield and open or closed it stays in place.
5,"This is a book that you love because of the amazing pictures. There is only one word per page, such as lollipop on the ""L"" page but the illustrations lead to great conversations and let the imagination open up. My son was picking from the people he loves and matching them to people in the book. It is a good book for young children."
5,This book is wonderfully accessible to someone who knows very little about woodworking. I have had trouble finding a book that I can actually understand and use. This one has helped me with fundamentals and I was able to complete the box project for a mother's day gift for my mother. It's nice to see that a company like Taunton Press respects the idea of women doing woodworking and is publishing a book like this.
5,"Thank you, Saddam, for your ""Mother of - "" contribution to the English Language. And thank you, Ingram Micro, for keeping me up night after night strategizin' and tacticizin' in battles large and small. This game was a blast and still is a blast, even though it's sorely outdated as far as graphics go. But, gameplay is far more important than prettiness, and that's where this game delivers.So far, I haven't found a turn-based modern warfare game with the magic of this one. Whether you're playing a skirmish or a tank battle that makes Kursk look like a sorority slapfight, the range of options in this game is awesome. You can be a lieutenant or a 4-star general.There was a Steel Panthers III, but I never got into it very much. Hopefully they'll crank out a 4 that captures the fun of 2 with better graphics and gameplay.-- JJ Timmins"
5,"I have always found self-help books wishy-washy and self-absorbed, but this book touched me. I am a mere amatuer as compared to some of the people who have posted here, I've only worn out one copy and am looking for a second, but since I'm only 18 I guess I'm off to a good start. The book is not about selling, but about guiding pricipals to success. I must confess i did not follow the books instructions, I merely reread the entire thing as often as I have time. There is a quote from it in my college essay, maybe I'll get lucky and get someone who's read it before. I would recommend it to anyone, fast-food worker to CEO."
5,"I read this book for the first time after a devastating professional loss, that made me question my career path. After reading this book, I pulled myself up made some changes to my overall career strategy and began to enjoy a tremendous amount of success. I am not a huge Carville fan, but this book is not about politics, it is about winning.I use the strategies and techniques I learned in this book everyday in sales and in Enterprise IT consulting.In fact, I think I will read this again"
5,"I wanted a good quality, but inexpensive and lightweight spotting scope and that is exactly what this is. It is quite durable as well. I am using it with a SLIK U8000 tripod and padded case. I have had it about 2 years with no problems. I use it for long range viewing and for watching wildlife. The view is clear and crisp enough for me, but will dim at high power like most zooms. This is not a problem in bright sunlight. The setup is light enough for short distance hiking. My only complaint would be that the zoom lens is not par focal. That is, it needs to be re-focused when you change power setting. That is the trade off on the price, though."
5,"If you thought that by simply leaving Discworld Terry Pratchett's ability to make you laugh out loud would somehow change (Ok Ok, I know, but I thought it somehow would...or maybe I just didn't think about it and read this one on faith too), guess again! This story had me laughing out loud, to the consternation of family members who just don't get it, and that is Ok by me, because I have found a writer in whom I can trust when it comes to spending a moment in a world a little bit to the left of my own--or to the right...I don't know, I love him though!"
5,"I bought this set on advice from previous reviewers. Thank you. It is outstanding performance. Very different from the modern performance practices were the orchestra is blazing and singers have to scream to be heard. None of these here. It is the singers opera. And they do a superb job. Tagliavini is outstanding all the way. His duets with Pagliughi is unsurpassed. The only minor complain is Lina Pagliughi's coloratura in the last Amina's caballeta. Not as clean as it could be. But that does not spoil overall quality of performance. The parformance has a very intimate, almost chamber feel to it.Very highly recommended."
5,"This book was introduced to me in 1992 during a painful divorce and I wasn't able to comprehend its gem like value. It wasn't until I rediscovered it on Amazon, and it is helping change my life before my eyes."
5,"This is a very good two-disc CD. The bansuri-player (flute-player), the tabla-player (drummer) and the tanpura-player (drone-lute-player) all do a fantastic work. The drone is played with a fifth and an octave counted from the lowest tone. All this music is like a caress for my ears and my mind."
5,"This is my favorite book! I think people who like horses and storms would like this book. It's the third in the series so if you like this book, you should also read Misty of Chincoteague and Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague."
5,"I hadn't seen this film before purchasing it, but I'm definitely glad I got it. My husband & I watched it the other night & we both agreed that it's probably one of the best movies we have seen in quite a while. Excellent story line & the actors are phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story & good acting."
5,I have this book in hard cover and now after my brain surgery I am having trouble seeing so I am glad to have found it on the Kindle Fire. It is a large book so it took a whild to down load. Had to have a full battery.
5,Nickel Creek plays instruments as if God himself was palying them and then you hear their voices its amazing they are perfect I love each and everyone of their songs you can listen to this cd no matter what mood your in they are great
5,"THIS ONE'S MAYBE KISS BEST ALBUM YET! I REALLY LOVE IT!IT'S HEAVY!SOME SONGS ARE SOME OF KISS GREATEST SONGS!GOT TO CHOOSE:9/10. HOT RIFF!

5,"stunningly beautiful photos of amazing shirts.graphic detail makes this book a must for anyone interested in the indians of the plains.these shirts are truly works of art and by just looking at them you can feel all the mystical and magical power that they evoked then and still do today.useful text accompanies the photos,highly recommended!!!!simon mote."
5,"Once again, Karen White has written a different and unique story that holds your attention from beginning to end. It's so easy to identify with her characters and to understand their feeling. Nice job, Ms. White!"
5,"The Closer with Keira Sedgewick as Deputy Chief of LA's special force is a wonderful ensemble performance with humor, quirkiness, character development and mystery. I look forward to each episode and am never disappointed in the casts' performance. I highly recommend this series. Well done and thoroughly enjoyable."
5,"I live alone, and enjoy a good cup of coffee fast. This machine does the job. I like not having to buy and mess with paper filters. It makes a good sized cup rather than a little tea cup, and it's easy to set up, use, and clean."
5,"The futon arrived in a heavy duty shipping bag (which made it easy to drag into the house). There was no damage to the packaging or the product. I set it up on the futon frame and am very pleased. For the price, this is a great product. It is comfortable and folds into the couch position with no problem.This is, in my opinion, a perfect mattress for the futon couch in the spare room. I even fell asleep on it. Would I sleep on it every night? No but then again, it is 99 bucks! I used to sell futons 20 years ago. The $99 price point that I sold was of way lesser quality than this futon."
5,"Her music is great! I love all the songs. My 2 favorites are ""Smoke"" and ""Leave Me Alone"". ""Smoke"" is the most beautiful song I've ever heard by a female artist.-Candy aka Megan B.L., the Cheesegirl"
5,"This was one of the best teen flicks I have seen since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Eugene Levy is hilarious as the nerdy horny father who is always helping his son.But I guess I won't be sending any of my kids to ""band camp."""
5,I use these to move boat lifts so they are exposed to grime and moisture EVERY USE and not treated with much care. I dry them out before storage and lube the mechanism with WD40 every 3rd or 4th use. They work great and hold up well to our abuse!
5,"I never considered myself a fan of Romance, but I watched Clannad / Clannad After Story because of its high ratings on review sites and I can safely say that it's certainly one of the best if not the best animes out there. While watching Clannad (Season 1) I was thinking about dropping the show after the first eight episodes, but I'm glad I didn't, because the show really got better. Like other reviewers, I sobbed quite a bit towards the end. I enjoyed After Story quite a bit more than the first season, but both are well worth watching. In fact, I actually watched both Clannad and Clannad: After Story online, and after enjoying them so much I went out and bought both on DvD here on Amazon to support the studio behind the series. =]. 5/5, a must watch. I'll end up watching it again because it's that good.Also - Definitely read the review by ""MedStudent"""
5,"I actually didn't care for Debra's first workout, but I thought I'd give her cardio/weight workout a try. I am SOOO glad I did. I love walking workouts, but needed a break from the ""walk, walk, walk!"" woman, and Debra fits that bill very nicely. Even though I am not overweight, I do want to keep fit, and aerobic workouts with turns and steps just don't work for me ... I end up getting frustrated and quitting. The cardio in this workout is a step up from my ""regular leader"" (okay, I'll just say it - Leslie Sansone) in that Debra adds some fun steps (mambos and cha-chas; dancey but NOT DIFFICULT!) and uses weights for better upper body work. Debra also has a very encouraging, positive attitude ... something to look forward to in the morning! Plus I LOVE the upbeat music! :-)"
5,"Just received from Kickstarter campaign -- am enjoying it, looks like I'll learn a lot. the illustrations look very clear."
5,"This is my second Franklin dictionary, the first one I bought about 20 years ago, and it still works properly. The display and the sound aren't as good as at the beginning, but... no wonder! I purchased a new one because it's so much easier to have a very good dictionary (thesaurus!) with one single touch, so small, by my side all the time... I'm familiar with many on line dictionaries, but then, you need a computer, and you need a connection, and you have to wait to all this things to start... I prefer my Franklin. It's fast,complete, light and easy."
5,"We recently purchased 2 sets of the Mikasa Classico Satin Ice Tea Spoons. They were received in minimum time and are exactly what we were looking for; long, well made and pleasing to the eye. Have washed them several times in the dishwasher and are holding up so far.....Would purchase another set if necessary."
5,No complaints about this. It's a very simple tool that works exactly as advertised. I like the carry pouch that comes with it. It has come in very handy as I have been building a network at my church.
5,A very easy read but astounding in the information it provides. Very basic life guidelines that will modify your daily thinking.
5,"K'wan does one hellava job with this one. All of his books are good I thought he wouldn't be able to top his book ""Gangsta"" I guess I was wrong. He switches the game up a little and shows how females get when you mess with their familyEve Panelli comes home from jail after 18 months and is right back in the streets looking for trouble. She comes home and sees that the two friends that she got locked up for is running the streets. Her love that she never wanted to tell loves her right back and together they go on the rampage of the streets. Although running to different vendetta's they both end up with the same one. Eve is faced with avenging her parents murder. When finding out who it was thats murdered her parents she goes after them by any means and doesn't care whose with her or against her.Eve and Felon both also avenges the deaths of their best friends murder.4 murders, 2 killers, who will survive and who will loose the final battle."
5,"I loved this album when I was 18, and I bought it recently and turns out I still love it. Good tunes."
5,"This book has answered questions for me that no one, not even many ministers, have been able to answer for me. In my time of doubt, ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" has lifted me up. Mr. Yancy, thank you."
5,"You are serious about having a personal relationship with God, this guide will help you to get there by learning how to find peace in every situation. One you will read and reread."
5,"I wanted to read some of Kincaid's fiction, and i most say Annie John was great. I love the humor in her books, and how the characthers seem to come alive. Annie John is about the relationship between her and her mother. It makes one think of there own relationship with there mother."
5,"Use this for my personal training clients.Very easy, just follow directions.Great to document starting point and set goals."
5,"If you have an annoying drip from your oil pan plug, just replace it with one of these copper gasket. This should solve the problem. It only comes with 3 gaskets, no plug."
5,"OK, I read all of the reviews now I just want to know where I can get one.Please respond with another review"
5,"From the opening jumble of feedback, this record lets you know where you stand in relation to the band - preferably a few yards back, and with a good set of earplugs (and I mean that in the most complementary way possible). The songs are crisp, the lyrics deal with subjects we all have a shot at relating to, and the band members definitley know how to play their instruments. The album leaps off on a brisk pace and keeps it up throughout, with the exception of the Title track, a lovely little piano-accented tune. Standout tracks include ""97th Tear"" and ""Dancin' when you're down"", a barn-burner complete with horn section that closes the album with a fist. My favorite thing about Gaunt is that they don't seem afraid to keep sounding like Gaunt; a rare trait these days. No, they're not floundering in a rut, they simply don't feel the need to abruptly change sounds to prove to us that they're musicians. That's a mighty good thing."
5,I saw this movie (4 hour version) in 1986 on a pay t.v. station. I have watched it once every couple of years since.
5,"Tamia's Between Freinds at first listen takes me back to her first to cd. That was while listen to them at work. Once i got home relaxed and gave it my full attention i found so much more. Man or woman if you have ever been hurt in a relationship you will feel it. This Young lady takes you thru. When i heard Me ... i had to go get my wine cause it was going to be a long night. The stand out to me are ME, WHEN A WOMAN , PLEASE PROTECT MY HEART, ALMOST ( DOWN SOUTH JAM ), LAST FIRST KISS AND LOVE & I.This was a great buy 5 stars..... much better then the last effort More... here she has more control over the over all product."
5,"Crazy/Beautiful is probably the best teen drama I have seen in a while.When I rented this I had expected another fluffy teen drama.Lets just say I was expecting another Here On Earth.But I rented it anyway because I am a huge Kirsten Dunst fan and I had heard only good things about this movie.When I sat down and watched it I was very surprised.The movie actually had real characters and not some characters thought up in ten minutes.The movies plot might no be a whole lot different from the plot of some of the other movies,but this one you can tell was thought in more than 15 minutes.Jay Hernandaz delivers an awesome breakthrough performance.I hope to see more of him in years to come.Kirsten Dunst hands in,probably,her best performance to date.Give this movie a try.Even if you don't like it,it's worth seeing the two actors do an amazing job"
5,I sent this CD to my daughter for car music when driving her baby around and she said it was a excellent CD both her and her baby as well as passangers love it very unique mix Enjoy.
5,"This is a Corrie collector's item. The original episodes are an absolute treat for those who remember Coronation Street in its early days. The Anniversary DVD is very interesting and enjoyable and the early episodes are priceless. This is a ""must have"" for lovers of Coronation Steet."
5,"unlike beyonce hit and miss solo debut and the disappointing ""destiny fullfilled"" this cd id the best thing to come out of the destiny's child camp since ""bootylicious"".kelly's solo debut is a class affiar from start 2 finish, there isn't 1 duff track here & all deserve the attention of all pop, r&b; and destiny's child fans out there.shame this didnt score higher in the charts or earn kelly as many awards as beyonce, as from the evidence of their solo material kelly truly is the 1 to watch out 4!"
5,"Eventually the red rubber part comes apart but it does take many, many years to do it. The first one I bought in London - maybe at Sassoons (?) - and I've been hooked ever since. When the first one wore out, we didn't have the internet then so I had to really do some searching and then I ordered four but two were immediately confiscated by my teenaged son who also has long, very thick hair. My Mom (same hair) also took one. Now we have wonderful Amazon and the net where you can find anything and today I am ordering two more. I LOVE these brushes. They feel good, they work wonderfully! I think I've used this type of Denman brush almost 40 years as I think I bought that first one in 1972..."
5,I never get tired of watching Gilligan's Island. I already had the first two seasons so now I have the third one.
5,"This is a wonderful movie about the overlay between nature and civilization, which quietly suggests that there isn't really much division between the two... As seen through the eyes of a humble, Zen-oriented bird-lover, the growth of a colony of runaway parrots in the San Francisco hills reveals both sadness (in their having been stolen from their native jungles) and beauty (in their thriving, cacophanous existence) and the wisdom in accepting what nature has to offer, both magical and grim. The original theater release is augmented by extensive bonus materials that really flesh out the history of the flock, both before and after the original film was made. Utterly fascinating."
5,"I just finished reading ""Through a Dark Mist."" What a wonderful romantic read! I couldn't put this one down. Not sure how I missed reading this book years ago. I was going through my bookshelf of to-be-read books and found this one. I have a bad/good habit of buying books and adding them to my bookshelves to be read somewhere down the line. I keep buying more even though I probably have enough to last my lifetime. Of course, there's no such thing as too many books. Soooo ... I picked this one off the shelf and pretty much read it non-stop. Nothing is better than a dark, handsome knight and a maiden in distress. Now I'm starting ""In the Shadow of Midnight"" which is Book II in this trilogy, the third being ""The Last Arrow."""
5,"This work adds to Maso's reputation as one of the most significant writers today. As Maso has suggested in the past, why are less known artists ignored in media, at the expense of well-known writers. Hopefully, this smart, beautifully engaging, and funny text will introduce a new audience to two influential and important artists."
5,"Dag, this is some smoothed out hotness.Futuristic, tight, it takes you away to what earth would be without pollution of negativity.Float on the BTV cloud, baby!"
5,"Don't even bother looking at other brushes. If you have a dog, you need one of these. It is amazing. Gets the undercoat too!!!! I feel like I could make a 2nd pet every week with how much fur this thing gets from my lab."
5,"this was the last of all elliott smith albums i have heard and by far the best. yes, its true, everything he has put out is amazing but either/or is really in my opinion his masterpeice. musically it really dosent make sence. the chords are odd and dont seem like they would fit together, but after listing to the album i think thats whats makes this album close to perfection. not one song is worth skipping over, either/or is the kind of album that you put in and just let play. i truley believe that elliott smith is the most talented song writer of this time."
5,"quick review:THIS IS A STORY OF BETRAYAL ALSO. AND IT'S IN AUTHOR ROCHELLE ALERS, HIDEAWAY SERIES.I LOVE THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT'S GOT SO MANY UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS IN THE PLOT, YOU NEVER EVEN SEE THE END COMING, AT LEAST NOT UNLESS YOU LOOK AHEAD.BUT IT'S ALSO A VERY PASSIONATE ROMANCE. CAN YOU SAY HO-OOO---OOOO-----TTT????WELL, I WANT TO KEEP READING IN THIS SERIES BECAUSE SO FAR THE BOOKS ARE WONDERFUL."
5,"I was going to buy a car charger from my cellular provider, but the cost was $39.99. Then, I saw this item under $10. I was skeptical. But the product works great, and very happy w/ the prompt deliver. Will definitely do business again. Thank you.Roberto H."
5,"This Bible is so easy to read and understand and written with great ""intent"" so you really get the underlying message God wants you to understand. I have recommended this book in my forthcoming book, God of Miracles (Publishing date: 3/99). I have purchased many of these books and given to friends and unbelievers so they can read the Bible, and they certainly do so with ""The Promise."" I strongly recommend this book for all those who really wish to ""understand"" the Word of God and have fun doing so! James Russell/author"
5,"Simply: The book's ending leaves you glad you read the book. While the book is quite interesting most of the way through, the conclusion was even better."
5,"I read the book a couple of years ago and was disturbed...but the movie really brought the message home for me. I actually enjoyed the movie very much and would highly recommend it. I guess that my expectations were pretty low coming in, but the A-List actors that took part in the project did wonders for what could have been an awful movie.A Caveat...if you're on the fence, you may find yourself headed down the road to veganism. After watching it, I thought that I may not be able to eat meat again...but then I got home and made myself some pepper steak all was well."
5,"I should have written a looong time ago. I've added an extra copyto our Canton 'Library"" just to loan out to new people or topeople who wonder ""what are you DOING""! Some things are differentfrom Kingdom to Kingdom but as a whole the ""Dream"" is the same allover. Buy it...read it!"
5,"I've wanted one of these for years, took me about 2 mins to install and works great. Should have looked years ago..."
5,"Anytime you see that name 'Sid Roth', you already expect to read something amazing and different. He doesn't disappoint in this book. The testimonies are amazing. This book is sure to have a huge impact on your life!"
5,I love this series and to get each season for such a small price and brand new! INCREDIBLE!!! Thank you Amazon!
5,This is a really good book I loved all of the suspense I live in Joan Lowery Nixon's neighborhood

5,"I took the Hale Clinic course with Alexander Stalmatsky, and after 30+ years of asthma I am at the very least symptom free. You wouldnt believe the other health benefits from learning to breath less unless you experience them first hand. The one thing I will say is that it takes effort and time to unlearn your current breathing patterns. So don't expect it to be easy or fast. You need to give it months.The key to the approach is practicing shallow breathing interspersed with different types of pauses. While I think everyone would benefit from taking a course or consulting with a professional, some may be able to learn it just by reading this book. Though I would recommend connecting with others doing it, for support and help with the nuances. There are online support groups on yahoo."
5,"This is the last album of what I consider the ""early"" Beatles; the band that was mainly concerned with love and its varied forms. The anguished ""Help starts off the mix, and it's probably the closest tune to the transition that was made with RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER. The rest of the album continues with the usual Beatles mix. It is wonderful collection of songs that deal with love; its joys and consequences. ""You've got to Hide Your Love Away"" is a truly beautiful tune with Lennon's pain clearly heard in his vocals. Harrison's ""I Need You"" follows right behind with its plaintive lyrics; HELP really is an emotional collection (By the time you get to ""Yesterday"" you realize ""regret"" is the theme to this recording. Excepting Ringo's performance on ""Act Naturally"" which seems to be out of place, (I love Ringo, but this one just doesn't fit.) and the unnecessary cover of ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" this one's nearly perfect."
5,"I love watching columbo try and figure out who did it, that is half the fun of the series. I have collected all the seasons so far and cant wait for the next one to come out. It is as good as it was on the first season, kids your folks will love these as gifts and folks heck with the kids bought columbo and remeber a simplier time in life lol."
5,"I received this item fast, in a good condition. Product is good as well. Aqua Di Gio is my all time favorite perfume.Love it when my husband wears it. Sensual and delicate scent. Recommend it."
5,"I had an unreasonable amount of fun reading this book aloud to my little ones. In fact, I think I love it more than they do. I also find myself reciting the words mindlessly while doing housework. Sandra Boynton is always fun, but this one may be my favorite (tough call -- might be a tie with ""Personal Penguin"" as sung by Davy Jones). Fans of Chicka Chicka Boom Boom will love it."
5,My husband and I were in the process of remodeling our kitchen when I bought this. Without a stove to boil water for tea and coffee we were microwaving our water (so gross) but this kettle works fast and it keeps the water hot for a long time. After our remodel I took it to work where I can use for tea.
5,"Don't know what to say about it, vampire movie.. not too much of a vampire fan, but I did enjoy this one and Interview with a Vampire."
5,"My favorite scene in Being John Malkovich is when JM himself goes into the portal...and the restaurant is filled with all different JM's. I was wondering as he was going down the tube what he was going to find by going into his portal. I will not ruin it for you. Watch this movie, if only for this scene!"
5,"By far one of the best movies ever. 2nd to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Although, at moments, I had no clue what the people were saying, it was fine otherwise, becuase this is a brilliant movie. After while, you get so used to the usual sterotypical plots of Hollywood, right? Wrong. The premises in this movie and the ending will leave you both stunned and laughing. I highly recommend it to anybody who likes to laugh."
5,Since I have been using my Sonicare brush my gums have improved 100% and my smile is wide and white.
5,"coleman/shore together are like what miles davis and angelo badalamenti would've come up with!yes,it's that good!have a few stiff drinks,pop this in,and close your eyes..."
5,"I bought one of these about six years ago at Wal-Mart, paying about $40. Bought it out of frustration over yet another Maglite failure at the worst possible moment. While the light is not really bright, these plastic Brinkmanns are TOUGH. I routinely demonstrate them to friends by twirling mine into the air, allowing it to bounce off the concrete. The light beam never falters. Batteries last FOREVER. Whether in a dark service tunnel, crawl space, or working on the car, I can rely on my Brinkmann. Bought this newer model for my Brother-in-law for Christmas, and a spare(finally) for myself. One thing that gives me some concern is the 3-way pushbutton off-on switch on this newer model. Seems to be a bit finicky. But what the heck. You can leave it on most of the time anyway. They're that good on batteries."
5,"Charriere is an engrossing storyteller. This book is about an innocent man's will to survive and escape the abhorrent conditions of the French penal institutions in Guiana. Unfortunately, there are countries in this world that similarly adopt such horrid practices. I also recommend ""Banco"" for those who enjoyed reading Papillon. It is about the further adventures of Charriere."
5,"I listened to this tape when I was very little, probably about three. It captivated me then, and instilled in me a fascination with this opera that haunts me still, over 12 years later. I would definately recommend it for your children!"
5,"I picked this up as an after thought when we bought our patio furniture. It was less expensive than the ones I had seen in store and although there were no reviews yet I decided to take a chance and I am so glad I did. This cover met and exceeded my expectations. We have a rectangle 4 chair set with 4 additional folding chairs and side table and this covers it all! We take the folding chairs and lay them on the table, put the side table underneath the larger one and the cover fits over nicely with a good amount of extra room. It also has 4 tie downs to keep it from flying away. All in all I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase one. After all we spend on our patio furniture it only makes sense to keep them covered when necessary to extend their lifespan."
5,I have been using this product for years and it is a great shampoo for dry scalps.It was recommended to me by a dermatologist.
5,"I do the Artist Way program every summer. It is a 12 week course that helps one get in touch with one's passion. I completely use the book and this year, I treated myself to the journal."
5,"For people who loves COMEDEY, this is a big chance to laugh. Louis de Funes is one of the best comedeans I ever saw, he is full of humor. It is a must see."
5,"As a busy mother of two young children, and at present 9 months pregnant, I seldom have the time or energy to read novels. After hearing about this book, I decided to make time. I am so glad that I did! Once I opened the book, I could not put it down. The story is about Lori, the baby who can only be described as ""God's baby"" as John refers to her. She had multiple odds against her, yet miraculously through her many painful surgeries and obstacles continues to shine her bright smile at the world. John's insight into his family's journey is both heartwrenching and inspirational. He describes a world of uncertainty about his daughters survival, describing treatments and medical interventions that are the things of parents nightmares, yet all the while he does so with dignity and strength. I have great admiration for Johns talent as an author and a parent. Thank you for sharing your story, I wish your family well."
5,"When I couldn't find clear rope lights at any of the local stores, like always I was able to find them here on Amazon. I am very happy with the quality of these rope lights. We used them to wrap around our square pillars in front of the house and they looked great. They were easy to connect together and stayed connected while being used. I would buy these again."
5,"The drill works great, batteries last a reasonable time. The clip on the drill to hook on a pocket is very handy. The carry case and flashlight could have been left out to save a dollar. I am very happy with this."
5,"Received, seasoned & used my new grill. It is great. Love the grill marks and will use this a lot and I know it will get better and better with time. Good size for two people and nice and heavy. Very happy with this purchase."
5,"This is straight up one of the funniest books I've read. The situations in which the main character finds himself might ring false to anyone NOT in academe, but for anyone who has ever taught in a rural Small Liberal Arts College (SLAC), it is wonderful! The character is flawed, as usual, in Richard Russo's books, making him loveable, yet stubborn and frustrating to read about. Yet he is so well meaning that one can't help but love him.I couldn't help but love him. Maybe it's because I recognized him in the characters I see on campus every day."
5,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It arrived quickly and in very good condition -- the CD plays well and the case was still intact. The music style of this CD is very soothing and relaxing to listen to. An enjoyable product.
5,Who knew a video game could give me the kind of work out that leaves me sore for the next 3 days? For the price of only two months worth of membership at my old gym! I would definitely recommend this game.
5,It was great. It really help support and took pressure off my lower back.
5,this book was so good because we did not go into depth in my history class so we did not learn of much of the pacific theatre of operations.we only learnt about island hopping and the atomic bomb.i really enjoyed the side pannels that explained stuff about certain people. this book was awesome
5,"The film is such a perfect depiction about the hesitation to let go or to keep tight the ones we love. The god of Death has taken the guy at the coffee shop away and he is waiting to deprive the life of the father. He even wants to take Jenny with them because he thinks he has fallen in love with her. However, it's not until he realizes that Jenny loves his disguised appearance but not himself that he decides to let go. Finally, he leaves the guy at the coffee shop to Jenny. Although it is hard to tell what is going to happen to the guy and Jenny, especially after Jenny knows her father's death the next morning, one thing for sure is that they will live together with unconditional love."
5,""".....The book INCLUDES A HISTORY OF MODELS FROM 1979 ON, including the Dodge St. Regis, Chrysler Newport, Dodge Diplomat, K-cars Dodge Aries K and Plymouth Reliant K, Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Intrepid.....""[from the book of the back cover]"
5,Jon Krakauer is an awesome writer. He explains his whole account clearly. I read this book in 3 days and it was hard to put it down. This is probably my favorite Travel book ever.
5,Knew I chose correctly when my wife said she liked it! It's cheap and easy to install. Helps keep more bugs outside. Would definately recommend this to anyone who owns a camper.
5,"I read there has been a lot of criticism re: the decision to cast Nick Jonas in the role of Marius for this concert. I did not find it a distraction. He does a credible job, not a great actor for certain, but he has a good singing voice. He was in the company of some very accomplished West End and internationally well known people and was bound to suffer by comparison. The DVD is a wonderful collection of orchestration and singing from Alfie Boe, Lea Solanga, Samantha Barks, Ramin Karimloo, Norm Lewis, Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Rebecca Caine, Frances Ruffelle and the casts from the two companies of Les Miz, playing in London at the time. They perform selections from the musical play, in a format that tells the story of this Victor Hugo novel. Good recording and well edited,. This DVD is a keeper with two plus hours of very listenable music."
5,"This is the third 3"" belt sander I've owned and it is by far the best. The 9903 is fairly light and the handles allow good control. It is indeed very quiet considering the power. I was very pleased at the 16' power cord. Belt changes are not a problem. And boy does this thing suck - I mean excellent dust collection. Sanding belt tracking is good and easy to adjust.This is a very nice sander. I wish all of my purchased tools did what they were supposed to do."
5,"This is one of the best debuts novels I ever read. The author captures your attention and never lets go. The suspense never lets up. I think suspense readers will definitely love this book. The tragic incident was heart wrenching. And you couldn't help but find yourself getting behind Louis. He is a very likable character. I wish the book could have been longer. I will definitely add to my ""authors to look for list"". I can't wait to read the next Louis Kincaid novel."
5,"This little USB drive is pretty typical, but it comes in handy. The reason I am so excited about it is I just sent it through the wash, complete cycle, then through the dryer, because I left it in my pants pocket. I remembered maybe 4 or 5 hours after the laundry was done, and I immediately groaned and found it right where I had left it, right in the pocket. I decided to try it to see how bad the damage was, and plugged it into my computer. I waited and then, all of a sudden, the little light lit up and I checked the drive. I did not lose any data! It still had full capacity! It was completely functioning! I tested the data transfer, and it still works. It was as if I had left it sitting on the desk rather than subjecting it to the terrors of the laundry. I was sufficiently amazed."
5,"I enjoyed using my Oral-B toothbrush very much. It was a bit firmer than I usually buy, but I really liked the way the head had sort of a pointed end that I could use to get behind my back teeth, and even under my bridges (now I'm showing my age!). I'd recommend this to anyone."
5,"Great snack, good source of vitamin C and Potassium. Much cheaper than in stores, much better than the standard supermarket ""candy"" type."
5,"It's hard to find a better feeder that shields the feeding birds from the elements and predators. Also, spacing of the grid is large enough to keep the birds from getting a wing or toe trapped if panicked. Great gift for anyone with a cat that likes to feed wild birds."
5,"I read reviews about the Thorne rooms and was so impressed that I bought this book, site unseen. It's absolutly breathtaking. I was just amazed at the quality of the minatures.The thing that struck me the most about this book though is the taste of the subject matter. Mrs Thorne had a fantasic eye for the classically beautiful and made a lifes work out of reproducing it for the enjoyment of others.This lady doesn't just cover different styles from different centuries. She showcases some of the most beautiful trends and styles from several different nations in a deceptivly simple format.The whole concept and execution is just astonishing. A must for an interior designer or anyone who genuinely loves period style."
5,"this hair dryer is great. I had an old hooded type and it was lost in a fire. I ordered this one after reaading alot of reviews. Couldn't be happier. Not that noisy, heats quickly, the size of the hood is big. I would recemond this hair dryer to any one that wants a compact, good hair dryer.."
5,"A long and eagerly anticipated CD ... this release was so watched for. I don't EVER remember waiting for a recording so anxiously! And it's more than I could have hoped for. I'm over the top for this man's music and can never seem to get enough! A fan since early 1980's after seeing John live on tour with Patty Smythe... to have had the privilege to see him live again this summer touring with Frampton and Journey just reinforces my initial reaction : W O W !Masterpiece of Loneliness is positively brilliant - heartstopping poetry - - this song will bring you to your knees. My other favorites are Fly (a fabulous piece which should be a monstrous hit) and the blasting rocker ""Godhead"". Out on the internet tonite.....go John. We want more. And then more.Francie/Boynton Beach, Florida"
5,We got this to put in our 4 yr olds stocking and he loved it. He is really interested in tornados
5,My husband and I love this DVD. The hymn truly are great hymns. I grew up in the Congo so of course I love the two songs on the DVD that are sung in the national dialect and in the style African style of worship. Takes me back to Congo every time.
5,I really love this music. The two cuts that were not on the original WordPerfect Demo disk fit very nicely into the overall grouping. The Prayer of the Children makes me cry inside and Electric Highway and Mastermind are two of my favorite pieces of music. I can't recommend this disk highly enough.
5,"Just took the Prof Ed Exam. I'm totally new to teaching so I was pretty worried. This book is the only thing I used to study. Passed it on the first try. I've tried the XAM books and the Cliffs Notes books on a few of my certifications and I've found the XAM books to be helpful (despite some nasty reviews on Amazon), but I find the Cliffs books to be slightly more helpful and, more importantly, they are WAY CHEAPER. The price is probably due to the amount in circulation as it seems they only publish the major tests (I can't find one for most of my SAE's). For the price, this book was solid. I studied it for about a week, took the practice tests and then studied those and passed first try.If they had books for all of the exams I need to take, I'd use them exclusively, but for now I shell out more $$ to get the XAM books which are a slight step down in quality."
5,"This is one of the CDs that I have played most in my life. A perfect mix of Chairman Parker's wit (caustic and otherwise), sing-along melody, empathy, love, soul."
5,"I am as grateful to Christina Pluhar for this introduction to Marco Beasley and Lucilla Galeazzi as I was to Paul Simon for Ladysmith Black Mombasa and Los Lobos. Beasley and Galeazzi are great singers.I also like this lively, inventive combination of ""antique"" music and ""folk"" music. It works just as well on L'Arpeggiata's recordings of Monteverdi and Landi.In the past six months I have purchased everything I could find recorded by L'Arpeggiata, Marco Beasley and Lucilla Galeazzi. I would recommend them all -- especially, Los Impossibles."
5,"its a romance without being female porn, its a thriller without all the gore... this book had a little bit of everything; it made me laugh, tear up, and bite my nails- sometimes all at the same time. It was just over all entertaining and I'd recomend it to anyone interested in staying in on a rainy day just reading in bed."
5,NOW SOME WOULD SAY I'S OK 4 THE PRICE..BUT HEY I SAY THIS IS JUST AWESOME WHEN I HOOK IT TO MY CAM IT GIVES A PROFESSIONAL LOOK AND THE SOUND IS AWESOME...ONLY DRAW BACK IT'S MONO..BUT THAT'S KOOL I USE THE MONO 2 STEREO ADOPTER
5,"This movie is a worthy addition to your DVD horror library. It features a refreshing balance of drama and horror. The horror builds very gradually, almost seeping into the lives of the main characters. Great acting, great directing.Very highly recommended."
5,I LUV EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE GUYS THEY MAKE GREAT MUSIC I LUV ALL OF THE SONG THIS IS A GOOD LUV CD I LUV IT ITZ GREAT ITS JUST WOW!!!!
5,"Item arrived on time and in condition as promised. However, the receiver informed me it was missing some segments he remembered from the series."
5,This box set beats any of the currently released Popeye DVD's. I have purchased others where they have overdubbed new sound effects and edited other material. It was horrible. I purchased this and couldn't be happier. My kids and I can't wait for the second installment to come out.
5,"First recommended by Oprah on one of her shows, ""Ishmael"" hasimpressed upon me the importance of leaving this world in thesame or better condition than when I arrived. The Takers aresure that the world is here for humans...the Leavers knowbetter. This book should be included in every High Schoolcurriculum, it is that important."
5,"Just a wonderful CD. I had it for 3 days and it seems that it's on continual play in the CD player. Powerful and passionate and everything I could hope, want and expect from U2.Welcome back."
5,"This is probably the best horror anime ever. The plot is tight and fast-moving, the characters well-rounded, and the animation is simply stunning.Dialogue is crisp and well-done, the voice acting is excellent, and the movie does a marvelous job of creating suspense."
5,"Invader Zim may have been shrewdly dumped by Nickalodeon because it was ""too dark"", but it's making a giant comeback on DVD!It centers around Zim, a too-short alien who's about three fries short of a Happy Meal; that believes that he has been sent by his leaders to destroy Earth, when in reality, they just sent him there to get rid of him.This cartoon is probably the most original I've ever seen, and one of the best animated and voiced. To not see it would be to really miss out."
5,"Totally awesome recording. As with with most Greatest Hits, could include more tunes. But, unlike most Greatest Hits, these are ALL great hits. How can they not be, we're talikng Molly Hatchet here!! Another must have for any southern rock fan."
5,"i've seen trojan war many times, yet no matter how many times i watch it, i never get bored of it. it's one of those films that's ALWAYS fun to watch, and it cheers you up if you're feeling down. there's this song at the end(when brad thinks he's getting what he wants), that really adds to the whole effect of the film, the problem is, i dunno what the song's called, so if anyone does, please e-mail me at blackvelveteen69@yahoo.com cheers ~caitlin~"
5,"This album, every song, has been reviewed to death. The title song is outstanding but most of what Van does is outstanding. I have read reviews of this album over the years. Most speak of the bluesy soul wrenching songs Cyprus Avenue and Madam George. These are wonderful songs. But, I'm a romantic. I could listen to Sweet Thing and The Way Young Lovers Do, forever. More importandly, although we own more than 20 Van Morrison albums, the three that are played repeatedly are Astril Weeks, The Best of Van Morrison Volume 2, and Poetic Champions. This is a ""must have"" CD."
5,"I actually purchased this product to repair my reel lawnmower handle. I compared several and went with this one as it seemed like it might be more cushiony than others, came in black, and was a three-pack for a mere $5. I am very pleased. It is not that thick, in case you are worried about that on your tennis racket. It is smooth, yet the rubberiness gives it traction. No problem mowing the lawn with sweaty hands. Two grips combined for the perfect length the wrap my mower handle (about 26"" long of 1.5"" diameter). I was skeptical that the adhesive tape included would hold well, but it does! I even had one wrap left, which I used to cover the handle on my sons' foam bat (the foam was coming off). Worked like a charm there too, and they love it. Makes it look more ""real"" too!Great deal for a small price. Happy wrapping."
5,Love the samples. i can carry them in my purse so if I have pain while I am not at home I am able to use the samples and I always carry extras just in case I need to share. This product is great for pain.
5,"put this cd in a huge stereo system, get drunk, put it on the last 15 seconds of song number 10 and your head will roll off! GUARANTEED! Also as soon as the vocals enter in song 4 I either want to cry for joy or murder an english crusader!"
5,product is well made and has safety features to avoid pinching your fingers when closing the ladder. Very sturdy and compact
5,"It came nicely packaged, included all 8 films in one unit, a lot of the box sets are using regular DVD cases I like the one they used for this box set. The quality was very good for DVDs although there is a blueray version of this available too if you want very high quality.I'm not supposed to rate the film but if I was I would be taking a star away. This was the first time I had seen the ending and was very disappointed. It felt rushed and not well made. But because I'm not rating the actual video on the disks I still give it 5 stars."
5,"Excellent sub. Tried several others ad this by far is the cleanest. Solid low end to my polk surround sattelites. Sub that came with the Polk system was unacceptable. Great deal from J&R Music World, $159 with free ship or Amazon for $167 free ship. Best Buy sells for $279-get a grip."
5,"I have never read such a comprehensive study theologically, culturally, and biblically on this subject. Amazing truths that have never been brought to light even by college bible classes. Very beneficial, full of information, and absolutely brilliant writers."
5,"Really, really enjoyed this film. A must see for anyone who wants to enjoy a decent, watchable film made on a shoe string budget"
5,I am an elementary music teacher. The Ice Cream Store is the most useful poetry book I have ever read
5,Who doesn't like Chris ROck! I was definitely feeling this show! The Dvd is great and got to me in good condition. Shipping was pretty fast.
5,"Not made for the iPad, but should be, works perfect as an iPad stand, either horizontal or vertical. Low price (and you get two of them) makes it a great buy, and perfect for travel."
5,"This CD is a blessing to have in my collection! The words to each song are listed and I am strict on the words to a song! This Cd has brought me up another level in my Christian walk.Bible Believers, when you are ready to listen & learn more about the Names of God...start with El Shaddai! Amen.Terry (Bronx, NY)"
5,"This author is not only a good friend of mine but also a very passionate writer who believes in his work. I was there for him when he went through alot of hard times and I am glad to see that he has overcome many of the trials and tribulations of life. I admire him for being the strong person that he is cause he could hsve called it ""quits"" at any time. My wife also enjoyed reading his poems and stated that she felt that they were truly from his heart. Keep doing what you do Jack, I love you like a brother. I am still awaiting to read the book that you were writing whlie we were in Jacksonville, Florida. Just Simply Brilliant Work!!!Your Friend,Tony Ross"
5,"Dr. Savage has a wonderful insight into the liberal mind. He takes the liberal arguments and then shows how ludicrous they really are. Liberals, including those ""high ranking"" left wing politicians, don't even make sense when they speak. Why is it that most Americans can see the fault in the liberal lunacy but keep electing extremists? Not only has Dr. Savage spent the required time in researching this book, he uses the liberals own mindset against them, showing that they really have no position or solutions to what they say is the problem. I, along with many others, have come to the conclusion that the left has no real position. The only platform they ""pontificate"" from is ""let's just apologize for being Americans and let the rest of the world tell us what we should think and how we should act"". Excellent work from an excellent mind!!"
5,"Sarah's second cd is my second favorite after Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. My favorite song on this album is ""The Path of Thorns"" it is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard! I also get a kick out of ""Backdoor Man"" and the catchy ""Wear Your Love like Heaven"". This album is a must for any die-hard sarah fan!"
5,"I caught the series on SciFi Channel during its initial run and was very disappointed when it was canceled. I can't recommend the Dresden Files highly enough though. Despite its relatively short run--13 episodes--it manages to charm you with its fun stories and lovable characters.Some will complain that it resembles the Joss Whedon show ""Angel"", but this is a misconception. In fact, tonally speaking, the shows are complete opposites. The Dresden Files is good natured fun, and good it is!"
5,My 2.5 yr old loves this turtle. Extra bonus I didn't think of when I bought it is that it is easy to take with you anywhere. It will come in handy on trips.
5,"I'm using XP pro and I have successfully used this with FREELANCER, DUNGEON SIEGE, and NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. I can't understand why others haven't had the same success. Maybe these people just need to READ THE FREAKING DOCUMENTATION!! When making a VCD of freelancer the only change I had to make (as it says in the docs) was to ""use intellegent extraction"". So far its worked wonderfully... best thing I've bought lately."
5,Litter clumps great and suppresses oders.It also is a money saver compared to other litters.It comes in a very strong bag so bag won't tear like some litter bags.
5,"Brilliant, Emma & I already have the CD just wanted the album as a collectors piece best songs they ever didBarry & Emma"
5,"I am very pleased with my purchase, I would recommend to anyone needing weather information. I use in my volunteer job as a weather spotter.Vernon Sneed"
5,Works great. Puts a TV where there's no wiring. Signal clear and strong. Had another model earlier that had interference from the microwave (TV in kitchen). This modle isn't bothered. Higher frequency.
5,Mas Oyama has written many books based on years of training and applied theory of Karate. He taught Kyukushin and this is the karateka's Bible!! I recommend this all martial artist and interested reader's!!
5,This lid is well made with a large and easy to grip handle and it works perfectly on my newer Farberware skillet with stainless steel on the bottom. It slips inside my old Farberware with the aluminum bottom since the exact size of similar looking Farberware pans has changed. I liked the lid so much better than the one that came with my old pan that I hoped it would be interchangeable. That does not change my feeling that this is a well made and reasonably priced lid.
5,"I love Zach Braff, and after following him and his co-stars in this sitcome I now LOVE Scrubs. Dr. Cox kills me with his sarcasm and I can't get enough of the episodes throughout the series. I look forward to more!"
5,"I checked the audio tapes out from the library on a whim. What a find. What a crack-up. When I started listening I kept laughing, but thought something must be wrong with me--isn't this a serious book? Nope. The car ride to Wales at the end was really funny. The lady who does the narrating is terrific. Maybe the book is for children, but adults should enjoy it too--if they are British comedy fans. The plot is pretty simple, so I'd say its main attraction is the humor."
5,This a great bargain. If you have leather furniture in you car and house then you need a lot of this stuff. Shipping was super fast. Very happy!
5,I really like this book and I really want this book but the seller has not sent it yet I've waited over a month. But I really find this book to be helpful and really connects with me and my experiences and want to have a book of my own.
5,"""The Right Stuff' is an epic movie that makes one feel like standing up and cheering at the end. It is brilliantly photographed and performed, and the script is easily the best of its type ever written. It is not only a great story about momentous events, but also a moving (and often very funny) look at the real people behind great events. I've known many test pilots and military fliers, and no movie has ever captured their often off-the-wall antics the way that this one does. Everyone involved in the making of this classic movie should have received an award of some kind - its lack of success at the box office is baffling. It is one of the few movies that I've owned in three formats (VHS, LD, and DVD), and the DVD version is easily the best yet - with the exception of the necessity to set subtitle and language selections every time one watches it.""The Right Stuff"" is history not as it was, but as it should have been."
5,"From just three years(1964-1967), The Beatles were ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"", to, ""I'd Love To Turn You On"", Just three years and only after three years the band was at there peak and was starting to go into the full relams of psychedelia music. Such songs as ""Love You To"", and ""Tommorow Never Knows"", were unheard of as ""pop"" songs at that time. The Beatles were taking a giant step though Revolver still has a few of there short and snippy love songs it really marked the beginning of a new era for the Beatles. Revolver is probaly one of the first mainstream albums that includes psychedelic music and was just a hint of what was too come in one years and how many great albums would come out and change music forever."
5,All I can say is WOW....this system is awesome. We probably won't be going to the movies quite as much now that we can bring theater sound to our living room...this is a great investment and so easy to hook up. We had is ready to go in under 30 minutes. I would recommend to anyone!
5,"This is an excellent book for anyone who's ever worked for a large corporation (for those who wisely decided not to, here's your proof!), and always dreamed of winning the lottery. What would you do? Read this book for some good pointers on how to get your revenge! It's an entertaining read cover-to-cover."
5,"THE SATAN BUG is one of my favorite modern day psychological manhunt dramas. It is well made biological doomsday thriller directed by John Sturges. I always amazed by George Maharis and his stoic, deadpan style of acting which he is well suited for here as the hero and main character of the film. SATAN BUG is a solid, engrossing and suspenseful film. This is good film-making all around right down to the performances, the script, cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. This film is truly haunting in nature. The black and white images, the darkness and shadows are indelible."
5,"A riveting thriller. This is a romantic thriller, a psychological thriller, a political thriller and an action thriller all rolled into one. Probably the best thriller since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE. I couldn't put it down."
5,"If you are not interested in the dull, grey, median, this cd is for you. Moby is flirting with the edges of the extreme, from trashy songs like Someone To Love and Heavy Flow to songs that are themselves a mix like Say It's All Mine towards the more usual Moby stuff. A pity most Moby fans don't like this.I don't see him do better than this ever..."
5,"Before HP6 came out, The Goblet of Fire was my favorite. This book beat it. Now my favorite Harry Potter Book, The Half-Blood Prince stirred up a lot of emotions with in me. I laughed, cried, was in shock, and spent a lot of time on the edge of my seat. I am 37 years old and started reading the Harry Potter books because of the excitement it was generating in my kids. JKR actually gave my children a desire to read. I personally don't think this book is appropriate for children under 13. I believe she has written a book series that grows as her fans grow. My now 16 year old will enjoy this book as much as he did the 1st one."
5,"Like the rest of the folks here, heard it in 1984, never forgot ""Perfect"" (ditto about NOT having the EPs of these songs released by the record industry - for shame), especially the EP of it. Sublime - ""This town ain't getting like a ghost town - it's getting like hell"" sure about summed up Buffalo, NY for me at the time. And that sneaky, Kraftwerk like chord that bursts through to end ""Giant"", which is the basic musical ""theme"" of the album. Had some rough times in the years when I first listened to this. Last year was the worst, and now that I am 32, I understood Matt Johnson's lyrics moreso now than I did then - ""Another year older and what have I done? My aspirations have been shrivled by the sun...I've been filled with useless information spewed forth by papers and radio stations..."" Matt will NEVER outdo this! Definately a ""DID""!"
5,"Bought this book for my 3rd grade book report, he enjoyed reading it . Very good book, especially for book reports."
5,"I used this paint with a Rustoleum striper. The paint is good, dries fast, and each can will give you about eight parking length stripes. You can get a more intense paint stripe by rolling the striper at a slower speed and using more paint. However, the paint will take longer to dry if it is applied thicker. I found that applying the paint in a thinner layer was sufficient for a parking area. In my application, I knew people would be using the parking within a short time after the painting was complete. In 30 minutes after application, people were walking on the stripes with no problem and it rained well before the recommended 8 hour cure time and again, there was no problem with the paint. This was easy to use and the job was fun to complete."
5,"This rice cooker is fast and easy. It is the first I have ever owned, so I do not understand what possible features other cookers at 3-4 times the price could have to justify the money. Go with this one."
5,This is such a great movie how can I do it justice with this review? You just have to see it. No spoiler alerts either. Just get this movie. I've watched it several times and I still haven't seen and understood everything in it. Worth watching over and over.
5,"Dark as usual, but the main character still has demons to overcome. It takes a junior police officer who grew up under the same circumstances as Bruce Wayne to bring Wayne out of his funk and bring the Batman back to life; to make him believe again.If you like action (The Unit, Breaking Bad) this movie will draw you in, make you identify with the characters and then put you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll."
5,"Tactics of the Crescent Moon is a survival guide for all those people that are involved in the current conflicts.Reading this book gives you a unique insight in the way the asymmetric or guerilla opponent thinks and acts.This book again, as all of John Poole's writing, calls out to the reader to use his best weapon - the brain.With all the examples and bits of information in the numerous references you can learn to identify the tell tale signs of militant Muslim action.This will help to save lives.This book is useful to everyone;policy and doctrine makers, tacticians, planners, trainers, commanders and leaders and most important of all - to soldiers.In fact I thought this book to be so current that I ordered additional copies to send to our troops that are deployed in areas where the described combat methods are used."
5,The actors bring the story to life as theplots unfold until the end of the film.The action seguences are outstanding.A job well done by the people that brought this movieto be for all to see.
5,"ok to all the spoiled rich kids out the who say psp rules....be quiet this is a classic so yes it will have bad graphics but its vintage duh! this came out probably while who spoiled rich kids were suckin on a pacifier...so quit complaining about oo its black and white and its old......and it doest play new games....this system has the BIGGEST library of games out therethis system was my first gameboy and i loved it, id pick it up if u like calssic games ...pokemon, mario,zelda, the games that made nintedo great...but if you love gta or just cause or jak 1,2 or 3..i wouldnt bother, the sophistication of a gameboy pocket surpasses your intelligence..im a 13 yr old kid and i love it, so pick it up ONLY IF YOU LIKE CLASSICS ....pokemon red and gold are good, buy those too if u buy this system"
5,"The Carnegie Collection was always my favorite brand of toy dinosaurs. The level of scientific accuracy is exquisite, especially for children's toys, and they are among the most durable dinosaur models I've ever owned. My Elasmosaurus figure in particular is over 12 years old, and aside from some slight fading of the paint, it looks as good as the day I bought it!"
5,"I bought my first one 12 yrs. ago, then 2 more about 11 yrs ago. I am still using the same ones all these years later. I never expected them to last this long. I make my own jerky, dry veggies and fruit, also some healthy snacks for my dogs. I run 8 trays on each one and it barely increases the drying time from just using 4. Great product with an extremely impressive long life. I would highly reccommend this product to anyone. FYI, wanting to increase my drying capacity, I purchaced a large dehydrator from Cabela's, almost the size of a dishwasher, with 24 trays......it's gathering dust in the garage, have used it twice."
5,"As an Executive Coach, I highly recommend Crucial Conversations. Many of my clients face the challenge of talking with their peers and/or direct reports on a daily basis. Most people don't handle those difficult conversations very well. This book gives great steps and info on how to go about treading through the difficult waters. I have purchased several copies of this book as gifts for clients. I am currently re-reading it in order to grasp and absorb the rich content."
5,"I was more or less familiar with rapture theology before I read Rapture. It was a great book because it helped solidify what the rapture is and how the Bible supports and does not support the rapture theology. Currie makes a thorough analysis of Daniel, the Apocalypse, Matthew, and some of the Epistles, focusing on passages that are relevant to the topic of the rapture. Furthermore, Currie cites early Church fathers to support his Biblical textual analysis. It is a wonderful read, and despite the difficulty of the topic, Currie does a good job of helping the common person understand the rapture."
5,"I have been an R.E.M fan since their ""Green"" days and am normally acustomed to their more earthy guitar ridden tunes. Naturally when I first listened to ""Up"" I wasn't so sure that I had made the best decision. Once I cleared my mind of the way I expected the album to sound, I found that I really enjoyed it. The many experiments with keyboards and synthesizers were most interesting and the lyrics, as always, are just as intellectually stimulating as their last albums. It takes an open mind to enjoy the album but once you rid yourself of expecting it to be the same kind of work as they have done years ago, you will fall in love with it like I have."
5,This was one of the best DVD sets I bought. Dvd would nice and sayed inthe box. My son loved this show when he was a kid and I bought it and Vol 2 for him.
5,"Heard this reviewed and recommended on Oprah's Book Club. Although it was written quite a few years ago, Oprah had recently read it and so glad I heard her review. I've always enjoyed Ken Follett, but I think this was his masterpiece. A thoroughly enjoyable read."
5,....spiritualityfor borrowers like me this book makes the most senseit helped me through a dark place.... again.it makes you feel connected to all those whom have tread before you and to the existing energies.and it will seem strangely familiar the first time you read it.good for people that don't want to be preached at or barked at and just want to be.... this will help you be whatever that isLao tzu also invented bowling.... discusshaenjoy the book and read a couple of chapters at most per sitting and absorb.
5,This music is wonderful!!! I love the movie and the music makes it even better!! I highly reccommend anyone to get this.
5,"I really enjoyed watching this.The case is well presented. And I wonder will we ever know the truth.Production quality, and seems well researched and very probable."
5,"Left behind the Movie the best Christain Film of our time if you read the book and read your bible along with it and talk with a pastor, You can understand the message that goes along with it.. if you are a christain there is a happy message within it but if you are not a christain now is the time to give your life to christ, now before christ comes to take all the christain back to heaven with him."
5,I bought this DVD because I was looking for a yoga DVD that also had some cardio in it. I like that it has 2 levels in it. It's a good intermediate yoga DVD.
5,"Monsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin) is a sad story about Monsieur Verdoux who is a swindling murderer that charms women whom he marries for their assets which he sells after he has murdered a newly acquired wife. Monsieur Verdoux is driven to commit murder as he feels determined to provide the best possible life style for his family. However, Monsieur Verdoux is lost in his determination as it clouds his moral decision making, which he recognizes. Monsieur Verdoux is the darkest of Charles Chaplin's films, and as in his other films it offers a social message. This ominous message becomes apparent from the beginning of the film as Monsieur Verdoux's gravestone is depicted in the initial shot with Chaplin's voiceover that embarks on how he ended up here. Chaplin's direction offers both tragedy and comedy which in the end leaves the audience with a charming, yet disturbing cinematic experience."
5,"Ignore those who would promote their own agenda by PC intimidation. It's hard to ignore facts, and Bernal's crowd has none. Hey, I guess the historians were correct: the Greeks are the bedrock of western civilization. Maybe the romans a little."
5,its fun for the whole family.verybody would like it.its so so so funny when the lizard goes in to the persons mouth when the two twins put it on the water bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"I wasn't born when all of this was going on - the 'Charismatic Renewal'. And John Sherrill wrote this in 1965 I believe. And it is just as relevant for today. It didn't read as something that came across as dated. It seemed very fresh. I loved all of his stories of various interactions with people who spoke in tongues. And it is well written, a page turner. I finished it in a few days and wished it was even longer!I have been a believer and speaker of tongues for over 30 years and never read this book until this year! But finding it now after being in the charismatic wing of christianity for over 30 years, well, it was inspiring and gave me a fresh boost of faith.There aren't many books of this caliber out there about tongues. I recommend this very highly. It's a great read and you will read it once you have it. It isn't one of those books that you start and kind of fizzle out on. You will not regret buying it, and you will wish it was longer."
5,"I went to this movie with my neighbor, liked it so much 3 days later I took my 9 year old daughter to it. We will never think of Cinderella in the same way again, the movie made the story believable!! We were thoroughly entertained, and can't wait to buy it, and I don't buy very many videos!!"
5,"This has been the best dump truck ever! I am sure my grandchildren will play with it one day and think it's new even then. It's large enough to hold almost anything a child would want to transport - including their 2-year-old sister. Though it's not designed for excellent steering, it does move smoothly and easily. We have had many hours of fun playing with this truck and won't be stopping anytime soon!"
5,"This group is ""Awesome"" If you haven't yet heard them, do.Takes you back to the disco era which is coming back."
5,If you have two batteries at least you must have one of these. It's perfect for my P500 batteries. Don't let your batteries charge in the camera it may harm it because it will get warm.
5,"Team Yakee is an outstanding look at how war affects people and personalities. Coyle used authentic tactics and real to life descriptions of the ups and downs of combat. A great novel. I also like his use of maps, glossaries, and how he switches between the US and USSR. Great Job!"
5,"I must preface this review by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the Crazyfrog ring tones. When I first saw a commercial for his ring tones while watching room raiders on mtv, I just HAD to get them on my phone. ..and for only $2.95/week, it was hard NOT TO that is such a good deal and my mom said its ok! Later that day, my phone rang while I was in this club wearing my totally kewl artifically aged von dutch mesh trucker's hat that I got at the mall, and of course my radical cell phone equipped with crazy frog doing the motorcycle. I picked it up and it was my mom saying to be outside the black bear in hoboken no later than 11pm so she can pick me up... but i still looked so kewl when it rang i kno it.But anyway this album is so awesome!!!!1111oneoenbbq 5 stars totally all the wayy! i just wish that crazy frog did more stuff like dis!"
5,"joe kelly and dough mahnke makes a perfect combination,just like morrison and quitely,or ennis and dillon,or loeb and sale,mills and bisley,jodorowsky&moebius.;and while i think morrison is very good,i prefer the way kelly writes jla.morrison is better suited for x-men.the story is fun,the characters well described and used.there's an exchange between bats and ww that are fantastic.or plastic man trying to get a peek at ww in her chambers.but the best of it is mahnke's artwork.superior to any of the artist who accompanied morrison on the jla.he's just getting better and better,since his days drawing the mask,and the classic mask versus lobo.he draws plastic man quite a bit like mask sometimes,the wildest i've seen him.at the end there's a separate short story about bats and plastic man that is just pure poetry.really excellent.after having read this,i'm certainly getting ""the obsidian age"" too!"
5,"It only took a couple of days to get the dictionary. It was in great shape, and the price for it was nice too."
5,I thought this was a real scary book. It gave me GOOSEBUMPS!!!! I hope R.L. Stine writes more scary books like Horrors of the Black Ring was.
5,this was an excellent gift to my daughter. The first time I heard the song she was 2 years old and I cried. So beautiful
5,"I'm sitting here listening to this CD, crying as I type this: that's how beautiful this music is. Right now track #2 is playing, E O Mai - the title track. I have had this CD for 3 or 4 years now, and let me assure you - you won't get tired of it. It's beautiful, and Keali'i's voice is smoother than glass. You'll love it."
5,"I found this film to be an engaging and honest look at the immigrant experience in the US. You won't be disappointed, the filmmaking is skillful and engrossing. Definitely a film that will open your eyes and keep you entertained at the same time."
5,"After using a multi wire stripper tool for years that I got from a nationwide radio chain back when I was in high school (I'm almost 40 now), this tool is a complete god send! I'm not a professional or anything but do do my share of things like creating my own speaker wires to custom lengths and other home theater and stereo tasks around the house.This is so fun, more comfortable and easier to use than my prior one. The handle plastic is not sliding off like the old tool either. I threw the old one away and was happy to do so. after getting this."
5,"Awesome CD, was good from the beginning to the end. Although I don't consider this CD as good as the other one, but it was a good CD, I mean all the tracks were a hit on the radio back when I was in Puerto Rico. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes salsa and is looking for something new to listen to."
5,Our Granddaughter Aubrey Elizabeth is three and she wanted her mama to go page by page through this whole book in the middle of seeing all of her gifts. She loves her princesses..............
5,After reading this book I will never view the forest the same again. It shows me how to look for clues to the past at every turn. At first I was skeptical then began to see the patterns described in the woods right by our cabin. Even when I drive the clues are there. If you have any relationship to a piece of land this book will make it richer.
5,"I second the remarks of the venerable Chris BCT--this is second only to ""Pick Your King"", simply because PYK is so short and fast that there are no spaces between the songs (on the vinyl copy anyway). To his classic lineup of the first three releases, I would only add ""War All the Time,"" which also stands up nicely.I was fortunate enough to see PI a couple times on their 1990 East Coast tour, and they were billiant. Still got my ""World's Loudest Drunks"" t-shirt."
